"-- nervous -- very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?",EAP
The disease had sharpened my senses -- not destroyed -- not dulled them.,EAP
Above all was the sense of hearing acute.,EAP
I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.,EAP
I heard many things in hell.,EAP
"How, then, am I mad?",EAP
and observe how healthily -- how calmly I can tell you the whole story.,EAP
"It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night.",EAP
Object there was none.,EAP
Passion there was none.,EAP
I loved the old man.,EAP
He had never wronged me.,EAP
He had never given me insult.,EAP
For his gold I had no desire.,EAP
I think it was his eye!,EAP
"yes, it was this!",EAP
"He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.",EAP
"Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees -- very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.",EAP
Now this is the point.,EAP
You fancy me mad.,EAP
But you should have seen me.,EAP
You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work!,EAP
I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.,EAP
"And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently!",EAP
"And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.",EAP
"Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in!",EAP
"I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep.",EAP
It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.,EAP
--would a madman have been so wise as this?,EAP
"And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously --oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.",EAP
"And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.",EAP
"And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night.",EAP
"So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.",EAP
Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door.,EAP
A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.,EAP
Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity.,EAP
I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.,EAP
"To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.",EAP
"I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled.",EAP
Now you may think that I drew back --but no.,EAP
"His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.",EAP
"I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --""Who's there?""",EAP
I kept quite still and said nothing.,EAP
"For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down.",EAP
"He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.",EAP
"Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.",EAP
"It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no!",EAP
--it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe.,EAP
I knew the sound well.,EAP
"Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me.",EAP
I say I knew it well.,EAP
"I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart.",EAP
"I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed.",EAP
His fears had been ever since growing upon him.,EAP
"He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not.",EAP
"He had been saying to himself --""It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor,"" or ""It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.""",EAP
"Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.",EAP
"All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim.",EAP
And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.,EAP
"When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern.",EAP
"So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.",EAP
"It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it.",EAP
"I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.",EAP
And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the senses?,EAP
"--now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.",EAP
"I knew that sound well, too.",EAP
It was the beating of the old man's heart.,EAP
"It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.",EAP
But even yet I refrained and kept still.,EAP
I held the lantern motionless.,EAP
I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye.,EAP
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased.,EAP
"It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant.",EAP
The old man's terror must have been extreme!,EAP
"It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!",EAP
--do you mark me well?,EAP
I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.,EAP
"And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.",EAP
"Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still.",EAP
"But the beating grew louder, louder!",EAP
I thought the heart must burst.,EAP
And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbor!,EAP
The old man's hour had come!,EAP
"With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.",EAP
He shrieked once --once only.,EAP
"In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him.",EAP
"I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done.",EAP
"But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound.",EAP
"This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall.",EAP
At length it ceased.,EAP
The old man was dead.,EAP
I removed the bed and examined the corpse.,EAP
"Yes, he was stone, stone dead.",EAP
I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.,EAP
There was no pulsation.,EAP
He was stone dead.,EAP
His eye would trouble me no more.,EAP
"If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body.",EAP
"The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.",EAP
First of all I dismembered the corpse.,EAP
I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.,EAP
"I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings.",EAP
"I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye -- not even his --could have detected any thing wrong.",EAP
There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever.,EAP
I had been too wary for that.,EAP
A tub had caught all --ha!,EAP
"When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight.",EAP
"As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.",EAP
"I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear?",EAP
"There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police.",EAP
"A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.",EAP
"I smiled, --for what had I to fear?",EAP
I bade the gentlemen welcome.,EAP
"The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream.",EAP
"The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country.",EAP
I took my visitors all over the house.,EAP
I bade them search --search well.,EAP
"I led them, at length, to his chamber.",EAP
"I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.",EAP
"In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.",EAP
The officers were satisfied.,EAP
My manner had convinced them.,EAP
I was singularly at ease.,EAP
"They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things.",EAP
"But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.",EAP
"My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted.",EAP
"The ringing became more distinct: --it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.",EAP
"No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice.",EAP
Yet the sound increased --and what could I do?,EAP
"It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.",EAP
I gasped for breath -- and yet the officers heard it not.,EAP
I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased.,EAP
"I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased.",EAP
Why would they not be gone?,EAP
"I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men -- but the noise steadily increased.",EAP
what could I do?,EAP
I foamed --I raved --I swore!,EAP
"I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased.",EAP
It grew louder --louder --louder!,EAP
"And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled.",EAP
Was it possible they heard not?,EAP
--they were making a mockery of my horror!,EAP
"--this I thought, and this I think.",EAP
But anything was better than this agony!,EAP
Anything was more tolerable than this derision!,EAP
I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer!,EAP
I felt that I must scream or die!,EAP
"I shrieked, ""dissemble no more!",EAP
I admit the deed!,EAP
--tear up the planks!,EAP
"--it is the beating of his hideous heart!""",EAP
"THERE are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.",EAP
"These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or to disgust.",EAP
They are with propriety handled only when the severity and majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them.,EAP
"We thrill, for example, with the most intense of ""pleasurable pain"" over the accounts of the Passage of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London, of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta.",EAP
But in these accounts it is the fact -- it is the reality -- it is the history which excites.,EAP
"As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.",EAP
"I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities on record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character of the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy.",EAP
"I need not remind the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster.",EAP
"The true wretchedness, indeed -- the ultimate woe -- is particular, not diffuse.",EAP
"That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit, and never by man the mass -- for this let us thank a merciful God!",EAP
"To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality.",EAP
"That it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those who think.",EAP
The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague.,EAP
"Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?",EAP
"We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations are merely suspensions, properly so called.",EAP
They are only temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism.,EAP
"A certain period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels.",EAP
"The silver cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken.",EAP
"But where, meantime, was the soul?",EAP
"Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such causes must produce such effects --that the well-known occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and then, to premature interments --apart from this consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such interments have actually taken place.",EAP
"I might refer at once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances.",EAP
"One of very remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense, and widely-extended excitement.",EAP
"The wife of one of the most respectable citizens-a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress --was seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skill of her physicians.",EAP
"After much suffering she died, or was supposed to die.",EAP
"No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not actually dead.",EAP
She presented all the ordinary appearances of death.,EAP
The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline.,EAP
The lips were of the usual marble pallor.,EAP
The eyes were lustreless.,EAP
There was no warmth.,EAP
"For three days the body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony rigidity.",EAP
"The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition.",EAP
"The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent years, was undisturbed.",EAP
"At the expiration of this term it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus; -- but, alas!",EAP
"how fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door!",EAP
"As its portals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms.",EAP
It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.,EAP
"A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape.",EAP
"A lamp which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by evaporation.",EAP
"On the uttermost of the steps which led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking the iron door.",EAP
"While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became entangled in some iron -- work which projected interiorly.",EAP
"Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect.",EAP
"In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France, attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction.",EAP
"The heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty.",EAP
"Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris.",EAP
"His talents and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence.",EAP
"After marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her.",EAP
"Having passed with him some wretched years, she died, -- at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her.",EAP
"She was buried -- not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the village of her nativity.",EAP
"Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses.",EAP
He reaches the grave.,EAP
"At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes.",EAP
"In fact, the lady had been buried alive.",EAP
"Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death.",EAP
He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village.,EAP
He employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning.,EAP
"In fine, she revived.",EAP
She recognized her preserver.,EAP
"She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health.",EAP
"Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it.",EAP
She bestowed it upon Bossuet.,EAP
"She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to America.",EAP
"Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady's appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her.",EAP
"They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife.",EAP
"This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the authority of the husband.",EAP
"The ""Chirurgical Journal"" of Leipsic -- a periodical of high authority and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate and republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the character in question.",EAP
"An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended.",EAP
Trepanning was accomplished successfully.,EAP
"He was bled, and many other of the ordinary means of relief were adopted.",EAP
"Gradually, however, he fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he died.",EAP
"The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the public cemeteries.",EAP
His funeral took place on Thursday.,EAP
"On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged with visiters, and about noon an intense excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath.",EAP
"At first little attention was paid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their natural effect upon the crowd.",EAP
"Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared.",EAP
"He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.",EAP
"He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic condition.",EAP
"After some hours he revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.",EAP
"From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into insensibility.",EAP
The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted.,EAP
"He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn.",EAP
"It was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position.",EAP
"This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical experiment.",EAP
"The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.",EAP
"The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London, who had been interred for two days.",EAP
"This occurred in 1831, and created, at the time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse.",EAP
"The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity of his medical attendants.",EAP
"Upon his seeming decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit it.",EAP
"As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.",EAP
"Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private hospitals.",EAP
"An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen, when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an application of the battery.",EAP
"One experiment succeeded another, and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the convulsive action.",EAP
"The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissection.",EAP
"A student, however, was especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles.",EAP
"A rough gash was made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds, and then -- spoke.",EAP
"What he said was unintelligible, but words were uttered; the syllabification was distinct.",EAP
"Having spoken, he fell heavily to the floor.",EAP
For some moments all were paralyzed with awe -- but the urgency of the case soon restored them their presence of mind.,EAP
"It was seen that Mr. Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon.",EAP
"Upon exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his friends -- from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended.",EAP
Their wonder -- their rapturous astonishment -- may be conceived.,EAP
"The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts.",EAP
"He declares that at no period was he altogether insensible -- that, dully and confusedly, he was aware of everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital.",EAP
"""I am alive,"" were the uncomprehended words which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.",EAP
"It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these -- but I forbear -- for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact that premature interments occur.",EAP
"When we reflect how very rarely, from the nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance.",EAP
"Scarcely, in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most fearful of suspicions.",EAP
Fearful indeed the suspicion -- but more fearful the doom!,EAP
"It may be asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is burial before death.",EAP
"The unendurable oppression of the lungs -- the stifling fumes from the damp earth -- the clinging to the death garments -- the rigid embrace of the narrow house -- the blackness of the absolute Night -- the silence like a sea that overwhelms -- the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm -- these things, with the thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be informed -- that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead -- these considerations, I say, carry into the heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil.",EAP
We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth -- we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell.,EAP
"And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated.",EAP
What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge -- of my own positive and personal experience.,EAP
"For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more definitive title.",EAP
"Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood.",EAP
Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree.,EAP
"Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated lethargy.",EAP
"He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs.",EAP
"Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks -- even for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death.",EAP
"Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay.",EAP
"The advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual.",EAP
"The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal.",EAP
"The fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding.",EAP
In this lies the principal security from inhumation.,EAP
"The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.",EAP
My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in medical books.,EAP
"Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation.",EAP
At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten.,EAP
"I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once.",EAP
"Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe.",EAP
Total annihilation could be no more.,EAP
"From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure.",EAP
Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night -- just so tardily -- just so wearily -- just so cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me.,EAP
"Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady -- unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as superinduced.",EAP
"Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity; -- the mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a condition of absolute abeyance.",EAP
In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral distress an infinitude.,EAP
"My fancy grew charnel, I talked ""of worms, of tombs, and epitaphs.""",EAP
"I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my brain.",EAP
The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night.,EAP
"In the former, the torture of meditation was excessive -- in the latter, supreme.",EAP
"When the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I shook -- shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse.",EAP
"When Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I consented to sleep -- for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I might find myself the tenant of a grave.",EAP
"And when, finally, I sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.",EAP
"From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision.",EAP
Methought I was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity.,EAP
"Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word ""Arise!""",EAP
The darkness was total.,EAP
I could not see the figure of him who had aroused me.,EAP
"I could call to mind neither the period at which I had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay.",EAP
"While I remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought, the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly, while the gibbering voice said again: ""Arise!",EAP
"did I not bid thee arise?""",EAP
"""And who,"" I demanded, ""art thou?""",EAP
"""I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,"" replied the voice, mournfully; ""I was mortal, but am fiend.",EAP
"I was merciless, but am pitiful.",EAP
Thou dost feel that I shudder.,EAP
"-- My teeth chatter as I speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of the night -- of the night without end.",EAP
But this hideousness is insufferable.,EAP
How canst thou tranquilly sleep?,EAP
I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies.,EAP
These sights are more than I can bear.,EAP
"Come with me into the outer Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves.",EAP
Is not this a spectacle of woe?,EAP
"I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.",EAP
"the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried.",EAP
"And of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been entombed.",EAP
"And the voice again said to me as I gazed: ""Is it not -- oh!",EAP
"is it not a pitiful sight?""",EAP
"-- but, before I could find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: ""Is it not -- O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight?""",EAP
"Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours.",EAP
"My nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror.",EAP
"I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home.",EAP
"In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be ascertained.",EAP
"I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends.",EAP
"I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable.",EAP
"I even went so far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me altogether.",EAP
It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most solemn promises.,EAP
"I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible.",EAP
"And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason -- would accept no consolation.",EAP
I entered into a series of elaborate precautions.,EAP
"Among other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within.",EAP
The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back.,EAP
"There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my reception.",EAP
"This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty.",EAP
"Besides all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse.",EAP
what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man?,EAP
"Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!",EAP
There arrived an epoch -- as often before there had arrived -- in which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence.,EAP
Slowly -- with a tortoise gradation -- approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day.,EAP
An apathetic endurance of dull pain.,EAP
No care -- no hope -- no effort.,EAP
"Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery.",EAP
"At length the slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in torrents from the temples to the heart.",EAP
And now the first positive effort to think.,EAP
And now the first endeavor to remember.,EAP
And now a partial and evanescent success.,EAP
"And now the memory has so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state.",EAP
I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep.,EAP
I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy.,EAP
"And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger -- by the one spectral and ever-prevalent idea.",EAP
"For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without motion.",EAP
I could not summon courage to move.,EAP
I dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate -- and yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was sure.,EAP
"Despair -- such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being -- despair alone urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes.",EAP
It was dark -- all dark.,EAP
I knew that the fit was over.,EAP
I knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed.,EAP
I knew that I had now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties -- and yet it was dark -- all dark -- the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that endureth for evermore.,EAP
"I endeavored to shriek-, and my lips and my parched tongue moved convulsively together in the attempt -- but no voice issued from the cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and struggling inspiration.",EAP
"The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead.",EAP
"I felt, too, that I lay upon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were, also, closely compressed.",EAP
"So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my limbs -- but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at length, with the wrists crossed.",EAP
"They struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face.",EAP
I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.,EAP
"And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub Hope -- for I thought of my precautions.",EAP
"I writhed, and made spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would not move.",EAP
I felt my wrists for the bell-rope: it was not to be found.,EAP
"And now the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared -- and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist earth.",EAP
The conclusion was irresistible.,EAP
I was not within the vault.,EAP
"I had fallen into a trance while absent from home-while among strangers -- when, or how, I could not remember -- and it was they who had buried me as a dog -- nailed up in some common coffin -- and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and nameless grave.",EAP
"As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud.",EAP
And in this second endeavor I succeeded.,EAP
"A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.",EAP
"said a gruff voice, in reply.",EAP
"""What the devil's the matter now!""",EAP
"""Get out o' that!""",EAP
"""What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a cattymount?""",EAP
"said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking individuals.",EAP
They did not arouse me from my slumber -- for I was wide awake when I screamed -- but they restored me to the full possession of my memory.,EAP
"This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia.",EAP
"Accompanied by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the banks of the James River.",EAP
"Night approached, and we were overtaken by a storm.",EAP
"The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter.",EAP
"We made the best of it, and passed the night on board.",EAP
I slept in one of the only two berths in the vessel -- and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need scarcely be described.,EAP
That which I occupied had no bedding of any kind.,EAP
Its extreme width was eighteen inches.,EAP
The distance of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same.,EAP
I found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in.,EAP
"Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision -- for it was no dream, and no nightmare -- arose naturally from the circumstances of my position -- from my ordinary bias of thought -- and from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time after awaking from slumber.",EAP
"The men who shook me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it.",EAP
From the load itself came the earthly smell.,EAP
"The bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary nightcap.",EAP
"The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the time, to those of actual sepulture.",EAP
They were fearfully -- they were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion.,EAP
My soul acquired tone -- acquired temper.,EAP
I took vigorous exercise.,EAP
I breathed the free air of Heaven.,EAP
I thought upon other subjects than Death.,EAP
I discarded my medical books.,EAP
"I read no ""Night Thoughts"" -- no fustian about churchyards -- no bugaboo tales -- such as this.",EAP
"In short, I became a new man, and lived a man's life.",EAP
"From that memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been less the consequence than the cause.",EAP
"There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell -- but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern.",EAP
"the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful -- but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us -- they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.",EAP
"THE mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis.",EAP
We appreciate them only in their effects.,EAP
"We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment.",EAP
"As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles.",EAP
He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play.,EAP
"He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension pr�ternatural.",EAP
"His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.",EAP
"The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis.",EAP
Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse.,EAP
"A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other.",EAP
"It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood.",EAP
"I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess.",EAP
"In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound.",EAP
The attention is here called powerfully into play.,EAP
"If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat.",EAP
"The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers.",EAP
"In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen.",EAP
"To be less abstract --Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected.",EAP
"It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherche movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect.",EAP
"Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.",EAP
"Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous.",EAP
Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis.,EAP
The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind.,EAP
"When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived.",EAP
"These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding.",EAP
"To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible.",EAP
"Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by ""the book,"" are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing.",EAP
But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced.,EAP
"He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences.",EAP
"So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation.",EAP
The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe.,EAP
"Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game.",EAP
"He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents.",EAP
"He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each.",EAP
"He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin.",EAP
From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit.,EAP
"He recognises what is played through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table.",EAP
"A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation --all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs.",EAP
"The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own.",EAP
"The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis.",EAP
"The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals.",EAP
"Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous.",EAP
"It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.",EAP
The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.,EAP
"Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18--, I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin.",EAP
"This young gentleman was of an excellent -- indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes.",EAP
"By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities.",EAP
"Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.",EAP
"Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion.",EAP
We saw each other again and again.,EAP
I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme.,EAP
"I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination.",EAP
"Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him.",EAP
"It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.",EAP
"Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen --although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature.",EAP
Our seclusion was perfect.,EAP
We admitted no visitors.,EAP
Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known in Paris.,EAP
We existed within ourselves alone.,EAP
It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?),EAP
"to be enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon.",EAP
The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence.,EAP
"At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays.",EAP
"By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams --reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness.",EAP
"Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.",EAP
At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin.,EAP
"He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise --if not exactly in its display --and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived.",EAP
"He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own.",EAP
"His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation.",EAP
"Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin --the creative and the resolvent.",EAP
"Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance.",EAP
"What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence.",EAP
But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.,EAP
"We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal.",EAP
"Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least.",EAP
"All at once Dupin broke forth with these words: ""He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Th��tre des Vari�t�s.""",EAP
"""There can be no doubt of that,"" I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations.",EAP
"In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.",EAP
"""Dupin,"" said I, gravely, ""this is beyond my comprehension.",EAP
"I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses.",EAP
"How was it possible you should know I was thinking of ___ ?""",EAP
"Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.",EAP
"___ ""of Chantilly,"" said he, ""why do you pause?",EAP
"You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.""",EAP
This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.,EAP
"Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the r�le of Xerxes, in Cr�billon's tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.",EAP
"""Tell me, for Heaven's sake,"" I exclaimed, ""the method --if method there is --by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.""",EAP
In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.,EAP
"""It was the fruiterer,"" replied my friend, ""who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne.""",EAP
"--you astonish me --I know no fruiterer whomsoever.""",EAP
"""The man who ran up against you as we entered the street --it may have been fifteen minutes ago.""",EAP
"I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C___ into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.",EAP
There was not a particle of charlatanerie about Dupin.,EAP
"""I will explain,"" he said, ""and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question.",EAP
"The larger links of the chain run thus --Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.""",EAP
"There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained.",EAP
The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal.,EAP
"What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth.",EAP
"He continued: ""We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C___.",EAP
This was the last subject we discussed.,EAP
"As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair.",EAP
"You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence.",EAP
"I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.",EAP
"""You kept your eyes upon the ground --glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks.",EAP
"Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomy,' a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement.",EAP
"I knew that you could not say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so.",EAP
You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps.,EAP
"But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday's 'Mus�e,' the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed.",EAP
"I mean the line Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it.",EAP
"It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly.",EAP
That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips.,EAP
You thought of the poor cobbler's immolation.,EAP
"So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height.",EAP
I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly.,EAP
"At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow --that Chantilly --he would do better at the Th��tre des Vari�t�s.""",EAP
"Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the ""Gazette des Tribunaux,"" when the following paragraphs arrested our attention.",EAP
"--This morning, about three o'clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame L'Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille L'Espanaye.",EAP
"After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two gendarmes.",EAP
"By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices, in angry contention, were distinguished, and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house.",EAP
"As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased, and everything remained perfectly quiet.",EAP
"The party spread themselves, and hurried from room to room.",EAP
"Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment.",EAP
"""The apartment was in the wildest disorder --the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions.",EAP
"There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor.",EAP
"On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood.",EAP
"On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots.",EAP
"Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of m�tal d'Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold.",EAP
"The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them.",EAP
A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead).,EAP
"It was open, with the key still in the door.",EAP
"It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.",EAP
"""Of Madame L'Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!)",EAP
"the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance.",EAP
The body was quite warm.,EAP
"Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged.",EAP
"Upon the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death.",EAP
"""After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell off.",EAP
"The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated --the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.",EAP
"""To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clew.""",EAP
The next day's paper had these additional particulars.,EAP
"""The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue.",EAP
"Many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair.""",EAP
"[The word 'affaire' has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys with us,] ""but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it.",EAP
We give below all the material testimony elicited.,EAP
"""Pauline Dubourg, laundress, deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period.",EAP
The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms --very affectionate towards each other.,EAP
They were excellent pay.,EAP
Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living.,EAP
Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a living.,EAP
Was reputed to have money put by.,EAP
Never met any persons in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home.,EAP
Was sure that they had no servant in employ.,EAP
There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story.,EAP
"""Pierre Moreau, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L'Espanaye for nearly four years.",EAP
"Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided there.",EAP
"The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found, for more than six years.",EAP
"It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons.",EAP
"The house was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any portion.",EAP
The old lady was childish.,EAP
Witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years.,EAP
The two lived an exceedingly retired life --were reputed to have money.,EAP
Had heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes --did not believe it.,EAP
"Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times.",EAP
"""Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect.",EAP
No one was spoken of as frequenting the house.,EAP
It was not known whether there were any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter.,EAP
The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened.,EAP
"Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story.",EAP
The house was a good house --not very old.,EAP
"""Isidore Mus�t, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house about three o'clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance.",EAP
"Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet --not with a crowbar.",EAP
"Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom nor top.",EAP
The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced --and then suddenly ceased.,EAP
"They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony --were loud and drawn out, not short and quick.",EAP
Witness led the way up stairs.,EAP
"Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention --the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller --a very strange voice.",EAP
"Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman.",EAP
Was positive that it was not a woman's voice.,EAP
Could distinguish the words 'sacr�' and 'diable.',EAP
The shrill voice was that of a foreigner.,EAP
Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman.,EAP
"Could not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish.",EAP
The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday.,EAP
"""Henri Duval, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house.",EAP
Corroborates the testimony of Mus�t in general.,EAP
"As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour.",EAP
"The shrill voice, this witness thinks, was that of an Italian.",EAP
Was certain it was not French.,EAP
Could not be sure that it was a man's voice.,EAP
It might have been a woman's.,EAP
Was not acquainted with the Italian language.,EAP
"Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian.",EAP
Knew Madame L. and her daughter.,EAP
Had conversed with both frequently.,EAP
Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.,EAP
This witness volunteered his testimony.,EAP
"Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter.",EAP
Is a native of Amsterdam.,EAP
Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks.,EAP
They lasted for several minutes --probably ten.,EAP
They were long and loud --very awful and distressing.,EAP
Was one of those who entered the building.,EAP
Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one.,EAP
Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a man --of a Frenchman.,EAP
Could not distinguish the words uttered.,EAP
They were loud and quick --unequal --spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger.,EAP
The voice was harsh --not so much shrill as harsh.,EAP
Could not call it a shrill voice.,EAP
"The gruff voice said repeatedly 'sacr�,' 'diable,' and once 'mon Dieu.'",EAP
"""Jules Mignaud, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine.",EAP
Is the elder Mignaud.,EAP
Madame L'Espanaye had some property.,EAP
Had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year ---- (eight years previously).,EAP
Made frequent deposits in small sums.,EAP
"Had checked for nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000 francs.",EAP
"This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk went home with the money.",EAP
"""Adolphe Le Bon, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L'Espanaye to her residence with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags.",EAP
"Upon the door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other.",EAP
He then bowed and departed.,EAP
Did not see any person in the street at the time.,EAP
It is a bye-street --very lonely.,EAP
"""William Bird, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house.",EAP
Has lived in Paris two years.,EAP
Was one of the first to ascend the stairs.,EAP
Heard the voices in contention.,EAP
The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.,EAP
"Could make out several words, but cannot now remember all.",EAP
Heard distinctly 'sacr�' and 'mon Dieu.',EAP
There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling --a scraping and scuffling sound.,EAP
The shrill voice was very loud --louder than the gruff one.,EAP
Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman.,EAP
Appeared to be that of a German.,EAP
Might have been a woman's voice.,EAP
Does not understand German.,EAP
"""Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it.",EAP
Every thing was perfectly silent --no groans or noises of any kind.,EAP
Upon forcing the door no person was seen.,EAP
"The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from within.",EAP
"A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked.",EAP
"The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked, with the key on the inside.",EAP
"A small room in the front of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage, was open, the door being ajar.",EAP
"This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth.",EAP
These were carefully removed and searched.,EAP
There was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched.,EAP
Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys.,EAP
"The house was a four story one, with garrets (mansardes.)",EAP
A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely --did not appear to have been opened for years.,EAP
"The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses.",EAP
Some made it as short as three minutes --some as long as five.,EAP
The door was opened with difficulty.,EAP
"""Alfonzo Garcio, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue.",EAP
Is a native of Spain.,EAP
Was one of the party who entered the house.,EAP
Did not proceed up stairs.,EAP
"Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation.",EAP
Heard the voices in contention.,EAP
The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.,EAP
Could not distinguish what was said.,EAP
The shrill voice was that of an Englishman --is sure of this.,EAP
"Does not understand the English language, but judges by the intonation.",EAP
"""Alberto Montani, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs.",EAP
Heard the voices in question.,EAP
The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.,EAP
The speaker appeared to be expostulating.,EAP

Spoke quick and unevenly.,EAP
Thinks it the voice of a Russian.,EAP
Corroborates the general testimony.,EAP
Never conversed with a native of Russia.,EAP
"""Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being.",EAP
"By 'sweeps' were meant cylindrical sweeping-brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys.",EAP
These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house.,EAP
There is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs.,EAP
The body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength.,EAP
"""Paul Dumas, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies about day-break.",EAP
They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found.,EAP
The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated.,EAP
The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances.,EAP
The throat was greatly chafed.,EAP
"There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers.",EAP
"The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded.",EAP
The tongue had been partially bitten through.,EAP
"A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee.",EAP
"In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown.",EAP
The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated.,EAP
All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered.,EAP
"The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side.",EAP
Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored.,EAP
It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted.,EAP
"A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron --a chair -- any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man.",EAP
No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon.,EAP
"The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered.",EAP
The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument --probably with a razor.,EAP
"""Alexandre Etienne, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the bodies.",EAP
"Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.",EAP
"""Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined.",EAP
"A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris --if indeed a murder has been committed at all.",EAP
The police are entirely at fault --an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature.,EAP
"There is not, however, the shadow of a clew apparent.""",EAP
"The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the Quartier St. Roch --that the premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose.",EAP
"A postscript, however, mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned --although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.",EAP
"Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair --at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments.",EAP
"It was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders.",EAP
I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery.,EAP
I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer.,EAP
"""We must not judge of the means,"" said Dupin, ""by this shell of an examination.",EAP
"The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more.",EAP
"There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment.",EAP
"They make a vast parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain's calling for his robe-de-chambre --pour mieux entendre la musique.",EAP
"The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity.",EAP
"When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail.",EAP
"Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man.",EAP
"But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations.",EAP
He impaired his vision by holding the object too close.,EAP
"He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole.",EAP
Thus there is such a thing as being too profound.,EAP
Truth is not always in a well.,EAP
"In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial.",EAP
"The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found.",EAP
The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies.,EAP
"To look at a star by glances --to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly -- is to have the best appreciation of its lustre --a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it.",EAP
"A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension.",EAP
"By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.",EAP
"""As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them.",EAP
"An inquiry will afford us amusement,"" (I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing) ""and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful.",EAP
We will go and see the premises with our own eyes.,EAP
"I know G___, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission.""",EAP
"The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue.",EAP
This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch.,EAP
It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided.,EAP
"The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way.",EAP
"It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge.",EAP
"Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building --Dupin, meanwhile, examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.",EAP
"Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge.",EAP
"We went up stairs --into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay.",EAP
"The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist.",EAP
"I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the ""Gazette des Tribunaux.""",EAP
Dupin scrutinized every thing --not excepting the bodies of the victims.,EAP
"We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout.",EAP
"The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure.",EAP
On our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.,EAP
"I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Je les m�nagais: --for this phrase there is no English equivalent.",EAP
"It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day.",EAP
"He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity.",EAP
"There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word ""peculiar,"" which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.",EAP
"""No, nothing peculiar,"" I said; ""nothing more, at least, than we both saw stated in the paper.""",EAP
"""The 'Gazette,' "" he replied, ""has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing.",EAP
But dismiss the idle opinions of this print.,EAP
"It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution --I mean for the outr� character of its features.",EAP
The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive --not for the murder itself --but for the atrocity of the murder.,EAP
"They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending.",EAP
"The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents.",EAP
They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse.,EAP
"But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true.",EAP
"In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before.'",EAP
"In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.""",EAP
I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.,EAP
"""I am now awaiting,"" continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment --""I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration.",EAP
"Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent.",EAP
I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle.,EAP
I look for the man here --in this room --every moment.,EAP
It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will.,EAP
"Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him.",EAP
"Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use.""",EAP
"I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy.",EAP
I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times.,EAP
"His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance.",EAP
"His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.",EAP
"""That the voices heard in contention,"" he said, ""by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence.",EAP
"This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed suicide.",EAP
I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction.,EAP
"Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention.",EAP
Let me now advert --not to the whole testimony respecting these voices --but to what was peculiar in that testimony.,EAP
"Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?""",EAP
"I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.",EAP
"""That was the evidence itself,"" said Dupin, ""but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence.",EAP
You have observed nothing distinctive.,EAP
Yet there was something to be observed.,EAP
"The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous.",EAP
"But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is --not that they disagreed --but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner.",EAP
Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen.,EAP
Each likens it --not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant --but the converse.,EAP
"The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.'",EAP
The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that 'not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.',EAP
"The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and 'does not understand German.'",EAP
"The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was that of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, 'as he has no knowledge of the English.'",EAP
"The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but 'has never conversed with a native of Russia.'",EAP
"A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by the intonation.'",EAP
"Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited!",EAP
"--in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar!",EAP
You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic --of an African.,EAP
"Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points.",EAP
The voice is termed by one witness 'harsh rather than shrill.',EAP
It is represented by two others to have been 'quick and unequal.',EAP
No words --no sounds resembling words --were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable.,EAP
"""I know not,"" continued Dupin, ""what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony --the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices --are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery.",EAP
I said 'legitimate deductions;' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed.,EAP
"I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result.",EAP
"What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet.",EAP
"I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form --a certain tendency --to my inquiries in the chamber.",EAP
"""Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber.",EAP
What shall we first seek here?,EAP
The means of egress employed by the murderers.,EAP
It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural events.,EAP
Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits.,EAP
"The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially.",EAP
"Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision.",EAP
"--Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress.",EAP
"It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs.",EAP
It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues.,EAP
"The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction.",EAP
No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance.,EAP
"But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own.",EAP
"There were, then, no secret issues.",EAP
"Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside.",EAP
Let us turn to the chimneys.,EAP
"These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat.",EAP
"The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows.",EAP
Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street.,EAP
"The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room.",EAP
"Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities.",EAP
"It is only left for us to prove that these apparent 'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such.",EAP
"""There are two windows in the chamber.",EAP
"One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible.",EAP
The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it.,EAP
The former was found securely fastened from within.,EAP
It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it.,EAP
"A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head.",EAP
"Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also.",EAP
The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions.,EAP
"And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.",EAP
"""My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given --because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality.",EAP
"""I proceeded to think thus --� posteriori.",EAP
The murderers did escape from one of these windows.,EAP
"This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened; --the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter.",EAP
Yet the sashes were fastened.,EAP
"They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves.",EAP
There was no escape from this conclusion.,EAP
"I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash.",EAP
"It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated.",EAP
"A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails.",EAP
A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring.,EAP
"I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.",EAP
"""I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively.",EAP
"A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught --but the nail could not have been replaced.",EAP
"The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations.",EAP
The assassins must have escaped through the other window.,EAP
"Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture.",EAP
"Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at the second casement.",EAP
"Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor.",EAP
I now looked at the nail.,EAP
"It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner --driven in nearly up to the head.",EAP
"""You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions.",EAP
"To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.'",EAP
The scent had never for an instant been lost.,EAP
There was no flaw in any link of the chain.,EAP
"I had traced the secret to its ultimate result, --and that result was the nail.",EAP
"It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew.",EAP
"'There must be something wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.'",EAP
"I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers.",EAP
"The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off.",EAP
"The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail.",EAP
"I now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete -- the fissure was invisible.",EAP
"Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed.",EAP
"I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect.",EAP
"""The riddle, so far, was now unriddled.",EAP
The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed.,EAP
"Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail, --farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.",EAP
"""The next question is that of the mode of descent.",EAP
Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building.,EAP
About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod.,EAP
"From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it.",EAP
"I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades --a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux.",EAP
"They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis --thus affording an excellent hold for the hands.",EAP
In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad.,EAP
"When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open --that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall.",EAP
"It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration.",EAP
"In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination.",EAP
"It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod.",EAP
"It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.",EAP
--By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work.,EAP
"Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.",EAP
"""I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat.",EAP
"It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished: --but, secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary --the almost pr�ternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it.",EAP
"""You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that 'to make out my case,' I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter.",EAP
"This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason.",EAP
My ultimate object is only the truth.,EAP
"My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxta-position, that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken, with that very peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected.""",EAP
At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin flitted over my mind.,EAP
"I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension, without power to comprehend --as men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember.",EAP
My friend went on with his discourse.,EAP
"""You will see,"" he said, ""that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress.",EAP
"It was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point.",EAP
Let us now revert to the interior of the room.,EAP
Let us survey the appearances here.,EAP
"The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them.",EAP
The conclusion here is absurd.,EAP
It is a mere guess --a very silly one --and no more.,EAP
How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained?,EAP
Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life --saw no company --seldom went out --had little use for numerous changes of habiliment.,EAP
Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies.,EAP
"If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best --why did he not take all?",EAP
"In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen?",EAP
The gold was abandoned.,EAP
"Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor.",EAP
"I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house.",EAP
"Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice.",EAP
"Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities -- that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration.",EAP
"In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence.",EAP
It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive.,EAP
"But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.",EAP
"""Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention --that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this --let us glance at the butchery itself.",EAP
"Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward.",EAP
Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this.,EAP
"Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered.",EAP
"In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit that there was something excessively outr� --something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men.",EAP
"Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!",EAP
"""Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous.",EAP
On the hearth were thick tresses --very thick tresses --of grey human hair.,EAP
These had been torn out by the roots.,EAP
You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together.,EAP
You saw the locks in question as well as myself.,EAP
Their roots (a hideous sight!),EAP
were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp --sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time.,EAP
"The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor.",EAP
I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds.,EAP
Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L'Espanaye I do not speak.,EAP
"Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct.",EAP
"The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed.",EAP
"This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them --because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.",EAP
"""If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification.",EAP
"What result, then, has ensued?",EAP
"What impression have I made upon your fancy?""",EAP
I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question.,EAP
"""A madman,"" I said, ""has done this deed --some raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring Maison de Sant�.""",EAP
"""In some respects,"" he replied, ""your idea is not irrelevant.",EAP
"But the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs.",EAP
"Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification.",EAP
"Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my hand.",EAP
I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L'Espanaye.,EAP
"Tell me what you can make of it.""",EAP
"I said, completely unnerved; ""this hair is most unusual --this is no human hair.""",EAP
"""I have not asserted that it is,"" said he; ""but, before we decide this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper.",EAP
"It is a fac-simile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as 'dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,' upon the throat of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a 'series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.'",EAP
"""You will perceive,"" continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, ""that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold.",EAP
There is no slipping apparent.,EAP
Each finger has retained --possibly until the death of the victim --the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself.,EAP
"Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them.""",EAP
I made the attempt in vain.,EAP
"""We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,"" he said.",EAP
"""The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical.",EAP
"Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the throat.",EAP
"Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again.""",EAP
I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before.,EAP
"""This,"" I said, ""is the mark of no human hand.""",EAP
"""Read now,"" replied Dupin, ""this passage from Cuvier.""",EAP
It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands.,EAP
"The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all.",EAP
I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.,EAP
"""The description of the digits,"" said I, as I made an end of reading, ""is in exact accordance with this drawing.",EAP
"I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them.",EAP
"This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier.",EAP
But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery.,EAP
"Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.""",EAP
"""True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice, --the expression, 'mon Dieu!'",EAP
"This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation.",EAP
"Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle.",EAP
A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder.,EAP
It is possible --indeed it is far more than probable --that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place.,EAP
The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him.,EAP
"He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it.",EAP
It is still at large.,EAP
"I will not pursue these guesses --for I have no right to call them more --since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another.",EAP
"We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such.",EAP
"If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement, which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of 'Le Monde,' (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our residence.""",EAP
"He handed me a paper, and I read thus: CAUGHT -- In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the ___ inst., (the morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species.",EAP
"The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping.",EAP
"___ , Rue ___, Faubourg St. Germain --au troisi�me.",EAP
"""How was it possible,"" I asked, ""that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?""",EAP
"""I do not know it,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""I am not sure of it.",EAP
"Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond.",EAP
"Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese.",EAP
I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod.,EAP
It could not have belonged to either of the deceased.,EAP
"Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement.",EAP
"If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire.",EAP
"But if I am right, a great point is gained.",EAP
"Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement --about demanding the Ourang-Outang.",EAP
He will reason thus: --'I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value --to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself --why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger?,EAP
"Here it is, within my grasp.",EAP
It was found in the Bois de Boulogne --at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery.,EAP
How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed?,EAP
The police are at fault --they have failed to procure the slightest clew.,EAP
"Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance.",EAP
"Above all, I am known.",EAP
The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast.,EAP
I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend.,EAP
"Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion.",EAP
It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast.,EAP
"I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.'",EAP
""" At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.",EAP
"""Be ready,"" said Dupin, ""with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself.""",EAP
"The front door of the house had been left open, and the visiter had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase.",EAP
"Now, however, he seemed to hesitate.",EAP
Presently we heard him descending.,EAP
"Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up.",EAP
"He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our chamber.",EAP
"""Come in,"" said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone.",EAP
"He was a sailor, evidently, --a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing.",EAP
"His face, greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio.",EAP
"He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed.",EAP
"He bowed awkwardly, and bade us ""good evening,"" in French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin.",EAP
"""Sit down, my friend,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""I suppose you have called about the Ourang-Outang.",EAP
"Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal.",EAP
"How old do you suppose him to be?""",EAP
"The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone: ""I have no way of telling --but he can't be more than four or five years old.",EAP
"Have you got him here?""",EAP
"""Oh no; we had no conveniences for keeping him here.",EAP
"He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by.",EAP
You can get him in the morning.,EAP
"Of course you are prepared to identify the property?""",EAP
"""To be sure I am, sir.""",EAP
"""I shall be sorry to part with him,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""I don't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,"" said the man.",EAP
"Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal -- that is to say, any thing in reason.""",EAP
"""Well,"" replied my friend, ""that is all very fair, to be sure.",EAP
--what should I have?,EAP
I will tell you.,EAP
My reward shall be this.,EAP
"You shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue.""",EAP
"Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly.",EAP
"Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket.",EAP
"He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.",EAP
The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.,EAP
"He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel; but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself.",EAP
He spoke not a word.,EAP
I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.,EAP
"""My friend,"" said Dupin, in a kind tone, ""you are alarming yourself unnecessarily --you are indeed.",EAP
We mean you no harm whatever.,EAP
"I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no injury.",EAP
I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue.,EAP
"It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them.",EAP
"From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter --means of which you could never have dreamed.",EAP
Now the thing stands thus.,EAP
"You have done nothing which you could have avoided --nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable.",EAP
"You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity.",EAP
You have nothing to conceal.,EAP
You have no reason for concealment.,EAP
"On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know.",EAP
"An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.""",EAP
"The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone.",EAP
"""So help me God,"" said he, after a brief pause, ""I will tell you all I know about this affair; --but I do not expect you to believe one half I say --I would be a fool indeed if I did.",EAP
"Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it.""",EAP
"What he stated was, in substance, this.",EAP
He had lately made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago.,EAP
"A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure.",EAP
Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang- Outang.,EAP
"This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession.",EAP
"After great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship.",EAP
His ultimate design was to sell it.,EAP
"Returning home from some sailors' frolic the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined.",EAP
"Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet.",EAP
"Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do.",EAP
"He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted.",EAP
"Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.",EAP
"The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it.",EAP
It then again made off.,EAP
In this manner the chase continued for a long time.,EAP
"The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning.",EAP
"In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L'Espanaye's chamber, in the fourth story of her house.",EAP
"Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed.",EAP
The whole feat did not occupy a minute.,EAP
The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.,EAP
"The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed.",EAP
"He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down.",EAP
"On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house.",EAP
This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive.,EAP
"A lightning-rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room.",EAP
At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror.,EAP
"Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue.",EAP
"Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room.",EAP
"It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor.",EAP
"The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived.",EAP
The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.,EAP
"As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L'Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber.",EAP
The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned.,EAP
The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath.,EAP
With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body.,EAP
The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy.,EAP
"Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired.",EAP
"Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible.",EAP
"The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear.",EAP
"Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead.",EAP
"In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong.",EAP
"As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home --dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang.",EAP
"The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute.",EAP
I have scarcely anything to add.,EAP
"The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door.",EAP
It must have closed the window as it passed through it.,EAP
"It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes.",EAP
"Le Bon was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police.",EAP
"This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business.",EAP
"""Let him talk,"" said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply.",EAP
"""Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience.",EAP
I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle.,EAP
"Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound.",EAP
In his wisdom is no stamen.,EAP
"It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna, -- or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish.",EAP
But he is a good creature after all.,EAP
"I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity.",EAP
"I mean the way he has 'de nier ce qui est, et d'expliquer ce qui n'est pas.'",EAP
IT was a chilly November afternoon.,EAP
"I had just consummated an unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic truffe formed not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit and liqueur.",EAP
"In the morning I had been reading Glover's ""Leonidas,"" Wilkie's ""Epigoniad,"" Lamartine's ""Pilgrimage,"" Barlow's ""Columbiad,"" Tuckermann's ""Sicily,"" and Griswold's ""Curiosities"" ; I am willing to confess, therefore, that I now felt a little stupid.",EAP
"I made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent Lafitte, and, all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair.",EAP
"Having carefully perused the column of ""houses to let,"" and the column of ""dogs lost,"" and then the two columns of ""wives and apprentices runaway,"" I attacked with great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the possibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result.",EAP
"I was about throwing away, in disgust, This folio of four pages, happy work Which not even critics criticise, when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which follows : ""The avenues to death are numerous and strange.",EAP
A London paper mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause.,EAP
"He was playing at 'puff the dart,' which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube.",EAP
"He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force, drew the needle into his throat.",EAP
"It entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him.""",EAP
"Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why.",EAP
"""This thing,"" I exclaimed, ""is a contemptible falsehood -- a poor hoax -- the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner -- of some wretched concoctor of accidents in Cocaigne.",EAP
"These fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of the age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities -- of odd accidents, as they term them; but to a reflecting intellect (like mine,"" I added, in parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose,) ""to a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these 'odd accidents' is by far the oddest accident of all.",EAP
"For my own part, I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the 'singular' about it.""",EAP
"""Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat !""",EAP
replied one of the most remarkable voices I ever heard.,EAP
"At first I took it for a rumbling in my ears -- such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk -- but, upon second thought, I considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and words.",EAP
"I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me no little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully around the room for the intruder.",EAP
"I could not, however, perceive any one at all.",EAP
"resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, ""you mus pe so dronk as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your zide.""",EAP
"Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable.",EAP
"His body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that character, and had a truly Falstaffian air.",EAP
"In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs.",EAP
"For arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward for hands.",EAP
All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid.,EAP
"This canteen (with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk.",EAP
"""I zay,"" said he, ""you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not zee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de goose, vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print.",EAP
"'Tiz de troof -- dat it iz -- eberry vord ob it.""",EAP
"""Who are you, pray ?""",EAP
"said I, with much dignity, although somewhat puzzled; ""how did you get here ?",EAP
"and what is it you are talking about ?""",EAP
"""Az vor ow I com'd ere,"" replied the figure, ""dat iz none of your pizzness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat I tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I com'd here for to let you zee for yourzelf.""",EAP

"dat you can't do.""",EAP
"said I, ""what do you mean ?",EAP
"-- I can't do what ?""",EAP
"""Ring de pell ;"" he replied, attempting a grin with his little villainous mouth.",EAP
"Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat into execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the arm-chair from which I had half arisen.",EAP
"I was utterly astounded; and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do.",EAP
"In the meantime, he continued his talk.",EAP
"""You zee,"" said he, ""it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall know who I pe.",EAP
Look at me !,EAP
"I am te Angel ov te Odd.""",EAP
"""And odd enough, too,"" I ventured to reply; ""but I was always under the impression that an angel had wings.""",EAP
"he cried, highly incensed, ""vat I pe do mit te wing ?",EAP

"""No -- oh no !""",EAP
"I replied, much alarmed, ""you are no chicken -- certainly not.""",EAP
"""Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I'll rap you again mid me vist.",EAP

"""And your business with me at present is -- is"" -- ""My pizzness !""",EAP
"ejaculated the thing, ""vy vat a low bred buppy you mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness !""",EAP
"This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder.",EAP
"Either he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantel-piece.",EAP
"As for the Angel, he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive raps upon the forehead as before.",EAP
"These reduced me at once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my eyes.",EAP
"said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at my distress; ""mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry.",EAP
You mos not trink it so strong -- you mos put te water in te wine.,EAP
"Here, trink dis, like a goot veller, und don't gry now -- don't !""",EAP
Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was about a third full of Port) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of his hand bottles.,EAP
"I observed that these bottles had labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed ""Kirschenwasser.""",EAP
"The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary discourse.",EAP
"I cannot pretend to recount all that he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the contretemps of mankind, and whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the skeptic.",EAP
"Once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way.",EAP
"He talked on, therefore, at great length, while I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the room.",EAP
"But, by-and-by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt.",EAP
"He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, ""beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens.""",EAP
His departure afforded me relief.,EAP
"The very few glasses of Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my custom after dinner.",EAP
"At six I had an appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that I should keep.",EAP
"The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal.",EAP
"Glancing upward at the clock on the mantel-piece, (for I felt too drowsy to take out my watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five minutes to spare.",EAP
It was half past five; I could easily walk to the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had never been known to exceed five and twenty.,EAP
"I felt sufficiently safe, therefore, and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith.",EAP
"Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the time-piece and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour.",EAP
"I betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement, it still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six.",EAP
"I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that it had ceased running.",EAP
"My watch informed me that it was half past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for my appointment.",EAP
"""It will make no difference,"" I said : ""I can call at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock ?""",EAP
"Upon examining it I discovered that one of the raisin stems which I had been filliping about the room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd, had flown through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the minute hand.",EAP
"said I, ""I see how it is.",EAP
This thing speaks for itself.,EAP
"A natural accident, such as will happen now and then !""",EAP
"I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour retired to bed.",EAP
"Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand at the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the ""Omnipresence of the Deity,"" I unfortunately fell asleep in less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.",EAP
My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of the Odd.,EAP
"Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I had treated him.",EAP
"He concluded a long harangue by taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwasser, which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm.",EAP
"My agony was at length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but not in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the hole.",EAP
"Very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire.",EAP
"In a few minutes the blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was wrapped in flames.",EAP
"All egress from my chamber, except through a window, was cut off.",EAP
"The crowd, however, quickly procured and raised a long ladder.",EAP
"By means of this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me of the Angel of the Odd, -- when this hog, I say, which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing-post than that afforded by the foot of the ladder.",EAP
In an instant I was precipitated and had the misfortune to fracture my arm.,EAP
"This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that, finally, I made up my mind to take a wife.",EAP
"There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows.",EAP
She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers.,EAP
I knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration.,EAP
"She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean.",EAP
"I know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was.",EAP
"I arose with a shining pate, wigless ; she in disdain and wrath, half buried in alien hair.",EAP
"Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but which the natural sequence of events had brought about.",EAP
"Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less implacable heart.",EAP
The fates were again propitious for a brief period; but again a trivial incident interfered.,EAP
"Meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged with the �lite of the city, I was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows, when a small particle of some foreign matter, lodging in the corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind.",EAP
"Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had disappeared -- irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted.",EAP
"While I stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident, (which might have happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to expect.",EAP
"He examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill, informed me that I had a drop in it, and (whatever a ""drop"" was) took it out, and afforded me relief.",EAP
"I now considered it high time to die, (since fortune had so determined to persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the nearest river.",EAP
"Here, divesting myself of my clothes, (for there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born), I threw myself headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his fellows.",EAP
No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel.,EAP
"Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit.",EAP
But my evil destiny attended me still.,EAP
"As I ran at full speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon terra-firma; the fact is, I had thrown myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which depended from a passing balloon.",EAP
"As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the terrific predicament in which I stood or rather hung, I exerted all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the �ronaut overhead.",EAP
But for a long time I exerted myself in vain.,EAP
"Either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me.",EAP
"Meantime the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more rapidly failed.",EAP
"I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air.",EAP
"Looking up, I perceived the Angel of the Odd.",EAP
"He was leaning with his arms folded, over the rim of the car ; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself and the universe.",EAP
"I was too much exhausted to speak, so I merely regarded him with an imploring air.",EAP
"For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he said nothing.",EAP
"At length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.",EAP
"""Who pe you,"" he asked, ""und what der teuffel you pe do dare ?""",EAP
"To this piece of impudence, cruelty and affectation, I could reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable ""Help !""",EAP
"echoed the ruffian -- ""not I. Dare iz te pottle -- elp yourself, und pe tam'd !""",EAP
"With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out.",EAP
"Impressed with this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold on.",EAP
"he said; ""don't pe in te urry -- don't.",EAP
"Will you pe take de odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your zenzes ?""",EAP
"I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice -- once in the negative, meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at present -- and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that I was sober and had positively come to my senses.",EAP
By these means I somewhat softened the Angel.,EAP
"""Und you pelief, ten,"" he inquired, ""at te last ?",EAP
"You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd ?""",EAP
I again nodded my head in assent.,EAP
"""Und you ave pelief in me, te Angel of te Odd ?""",EAP
"""Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool ?""",EAP
I nodded once more.,EAP
"""Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.""",EAP
"This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible to do.",EAP
"In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand, I must have let go altogether.",EAP
"In the second place, I could have no breeches until I came across the crow.",EAP
"I was therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the negative -- intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very reasonable demand !",EAP
"No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking my head than -- ""Go to der teuffel, ten !""",EAP
roared the Angel of the Odd.,EAP
"In pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the guide-rope by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to be precisely over my own house, (which, during my peregrinations, had been handsomely rebuilt,) it so occurred that I tumbled headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room hearth.",EAP
"Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me,) I found it about four o'clock in the morning.",EAP
I lay outstretched where I had fallen from the balloon.,EAP
"My head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser.",EAP
Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd.,EAP
I AM come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion.,EAP
"Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence -- whether much that is glorious- whether all that is profound -- does not spring from disease of thought -- from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect.",EAP
They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.,EAP
"In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret.",EAP
"In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.",EAP
"They penetrate, however, rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the ""light ineffable,"" and again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer, ""agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.""",EAP
"We will say, then, that I am mad.",EAP
"I grant, at least, that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence -- the condition of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life -- and a condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being.",EAP
"Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.",EAP
"She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed.",EAP
Eleonora was the name of my cousin.,EAP
"We had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.",EAP
"No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses.",EAP
"No path was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers.",EAP
"Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the valley -- I, and my cousin, and her mother.",EAP
"From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued.",EAP
"We called it the ""River of Silence""; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.",EAP
"No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old station, shining on gloriously forever.",EAP
"The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom, -- these spots, not less than the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.",EAP
"And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley.",EAP
"Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.",EAP
"Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts.",EAP
"It was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other's embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at our images therein.",EAP
"We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few.",EAP
"We had drawn the God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers.",EAP
"The passions which had for centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.",EAP
A change fell upon all things.,EAP
"Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before.",EAP
"The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel.",EAP
"And life arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.",EAP
"The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus-sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora.",EAP
"And now, too, a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.",EAP
The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers.,EAP
"No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein.",EAP
"At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive variation of phrase.",EAP
"She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom -- that, like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of Silence.",EAP
"She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world.",EAP
"And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of Earth -- that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me.",EAP
And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow.,EAP
"And the curse which I invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here.",EAP
"And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?)",EAP
and it made easy to her the bed of her death.,EAP
"And she said to me, not many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.",EAP
"And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.",EAP
Thus far I have faithfully said.,EAP
"But as I pass the barrier in Times path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I mistrust the perfect sanity of the record.",EAP
But let me on.,EAP
"-- Years dragged themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things.",EAP
"The star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more.",EAP
"The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew.",EAP
"And Life departed from our paths; for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company.",EAP
And the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again.,EAP
"And the lulling melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of Aeolus, and more divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its original silence.",EAP
"And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.",EAP
"Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and once -- oh, but once only!",EAP
"I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.",EAP
"But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled.",EAP
I longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing.,EAP
"At length the valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.",EAP
"I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.",EAP
"The pomps and pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women, bewildered and intoxicated my brain.",EAP
"But as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night.",EAP
"Suddenly these manifestations they ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once -- at whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love.",EAP
"What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?",EAP
"-- Oh, bright was the seraph Ermengarde!",EAP
and in that knowledge I had room for none other.,EAP
"-- Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde!",EAP
"and as I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them -- and of her.",EAP
I wedded; -- nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness was not visited upon me.,EAP
"And once -- but once again in the silence of the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying: ""Sleep in peace!",EAP
"-- for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.""",EAP
"LET me call myself, for the present, William Wilson.",EAP
The fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation.,EAP
"This has been already too much an object for the scorn, for the horror, for the detestation of my race.",EAP
To the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy?,EAP
"Oh, outcast of all outcasts most abandoned!",EAP
To the earth art thou not forever dead?,EAP
"to its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",EAP
"and a cloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven?",EAP
"I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime.",EAP
"This epoch -- these later years -- took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign.",EAP
Men usually grow base by degrees.,EAP
"From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle.",EAP
I shrouded my nakedness in triple guilt.,EAP
"From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus.",EAP
"What chance -- what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate.",EAP
Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit.,EAP
"I long, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy -- I had nearly said for the pity -- of my fellow-men.",EAP
"I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control.",EAP
"I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error.",EAP
"I would have them allow -- what they cannot refrain from allowing -- that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before -- certainly, never thus fell.",EAP
And it is therefore that he has never thus suffered.,EAP
Have I not indeed been living in a dream?,EAP
And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?,EAP
"I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character.",EAP
"As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to myself.",EAP
"I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.",EAP
"Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me.",EAP
"Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine.",EAP
"Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own actions.",EAP
"My earliest recollections of a school-life are connected with a large, rambling, cottage-built, and somewhat decayed building in a misty-looking village of England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were excessively ancient.",EAP
"In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town.",EAP
"At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep, hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the old, fretted, Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.",EAP
"It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns.",EAP
"Steeped in misery as I am -- misery, alas!",EAP
"only too real -- I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details.",EAP
"These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance as connected with a period and a locality, when and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me.",EAP
Let me then remember.,EAP
"The house, I have said, was old, irregular, and cottage-built.",EAP
"The grounds were extensive, and an enormously high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole.",EAP
This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain.,EAP
"Beyond it we saw but thrice a week -- once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields -- and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.",EAP
Of this church the principal of our school was pastor.,EAP
"With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit!",EAP
"This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast -- could this be he who of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy?",EAP
"Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!",EAP
At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.,EAP
"It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron spikes.",EAP
What impressions of deep awe did it inspire!,EAP
"It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges we found a plenitude of mystery, a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.",EAP
"The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses.",EAP
"Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground.",EAP
"It was level, and covered with fine, hard gravel.",EAP
"I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it.",EAP
Of course it was in the rear of the house.,EAP
"In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed, such as a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holydays.",EAP
But the house -- how quaint an old building was this!,EAP
-- to me how veritably a palace of enchantment!,EAP
"There was really no end to its windings, to its incomprehensible subdivisions.",EAP
"It was impossible, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be.",EAP
From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent.,EAP
"Then the lateral branches were innumerable -- inconceivable -- and so returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity.",EAP
"During the five years of my residence here I was never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.",EAP
The school-room was the largest in the house -- I could not help thinking in the world.,EAP
"It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak.",EAP
"In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, ""during hours,"" of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby.",EAP
"It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the ""Dominie,"" we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure.",EAP
"In other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe.",EAP
"One of these was the pulpit of ""the classical"" usher, one of the ""English and mathematical.""",EAP
"Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, meaningless gashes, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed.",EAP
"A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.",EAP
"Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life.",EAP
"The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime.",EAP
Yet I must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon -- even much of the outr�.,EAP
Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression.,EAP
All is gray shadow -- a weak and irregular remembrance -- an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains.,EAP
With me this is not so.,EAP
"In childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the exergues of the Carthaginian medals.",EAP
Yet in fact -- in the fact of the world's view -- how little was there to remember!,EAP
"The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues -- these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring.",EAP
"""Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer! """,EAP
"In truth, the ardency, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendency over all not greatly older than myself; -- over all with one single exception.",EAP
"This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself; -- a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable, for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those every-day appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob.",EAP
In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson -- a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.,EAP
"My namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted ""our set,"" presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class -- in the sports and broils of the play-ground -- to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will -- indeed to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever.",EAP
"If there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.",EAP
"Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; -- the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority, since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle.",EAP
"Yet this superiority -- even this equality -- was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it.",EAP
"Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private.",EAP
"He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel.",EAP
"In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner.",EAP
I could only conceive this singular behaviour to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.,EAP
"Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy.",EAP
These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors.,EAP
"I have before said, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected with my family.",EAP
"But assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins, for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1811 -- a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.",EAP
"It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether.",EAP
"We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel, in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride upon my part, and a veritable dignity upon his own, kept us always upon what are called ""speaking terms,"" while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in me a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship.",EAP
"It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards him.",EAP
"They formed a heterogeneous mixture -- some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity.",EAP
"It will scarcely be necessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.",EAP
"It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into that of a more serious and determined hostility.",EAP
"But my endeavors on this head were by no means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at.",EAP
"I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself; -- my rival had a weakness in the faucial or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper.",EAP
Of this defect I did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.,EAP
"Wilson's retaliations in kind were many, and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure.",EAP
"How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the annoyance.",EAP
"I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian praenomen.",EAP
"The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must, inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own.",EAP
"The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my rival and myself.",EAP
"I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I perceived that we were not altogether unlike in general contour of person and outline of feature.",EAP
"I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper forms.",EAP
"In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us.",EAP
"But, in truth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself), this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows.",EAP
"That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent, but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance for myself can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration.",EAP
"His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part.",EAP
"My dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner, were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him.",EAP
"My louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo of my own.",EAP
"How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe.",EAP
"I had but one consolation -- in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself.",EAP
"Satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavors might have so easily elicited.",EAP
"That the school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many months, a riddle I could not resolve.",EAP
"Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible, or, more possibly, I owed my security to the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, which in a painting is all the obtuse can see, gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.",EAP
"I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed towards me, and of his frequent officious interference with my will.",EAP
"This interference often took the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated.",EAP
I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years.,EAP
"Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age, and seeming inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, today, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially hated, and too bitterly despised.",EAP
"As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme, under his distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his arrogance.",EAP
"I have said that, in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred.",EAP
"Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me.",EAP
"It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy -- wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn.",EAP
"I cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me, than by saying I could with difficulty shake off the belief that myself and the being who stood before me had been acquainted at some epoch very long ago; some point of the past even infinitely remote.",EAP
"The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular namesake.",EAP
"The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several enormously large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number of the students.",EAP
"There were, however, as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned, many little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were capable of accommodating only a single individual.",EAP
One of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.,EAP
"It was upon a gloomy and tempestuous night of an early autumn, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, that, finding every one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival.",EAP
I had been long plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.,EAP
"It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.",EAP
"Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside.",EAP
"I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing.",EAP
"Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed.",EAP
"Close curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance.",EAP
"I looked, and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame.",EAP
"My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror.",EAP
"Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face.",EAP
Were these -- these the lineaments of William Wilson?,EAP
"I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not.",EAP
What was there about them to confound me in this manner?,EAP
I gazed -- while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.,EAP
Not thus he appeared -- assuredly not thus -- in the vivacity of his waking hours.,EAP
The same name; the same contour of person; the same day of arrival at the academy!,EAP
"And then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner!",EAP
"Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility that what I now saw was the result of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?",EAP
"Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.",EAP
"After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton.",EAP
"The brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them.",EAP
"The truth, the tragedy, of the drama was no more.",EAP
"I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses, and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed.",EAP
Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton.,EAP
"The vortex of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.",EAP
"I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here -- a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the vigilance of the institution.",EAP
"Three years of folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers.",EAP
"We met at a late hour of the night, for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning.",EAP
"The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other, and perhaps more dangerous, seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height.",EAP
"Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice from without of a servant.",EAP
"He said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.",EAP
"Wildly excited with the potent Vin de Barac, the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me.",EAP
"I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building.",EAP
"In this low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through a semicircular window.",EAP
"As I put my foot over the threshold I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and (what then peculiarly struck my mad fancy) habited in a white cassimere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment.",EAP
This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish.,EAP
"Immediately upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words ""William Wilson!""",EAP
I grew perfectly sober in an instant.,EAP
"There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me.",EAP
"It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered, syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of by-gone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery.",EAP
Ere I could recover the use of my senses he was gone.,EAP
"Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid.",EAP
"For some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation.",EAP
"I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel.",EAP
But who and what was this Wilson?,EAP
-- and whence came he?,EAP
-- and what were his purposes?,EAP
"Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped.",EAP
But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford.,EAP
"Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit, and annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart -- to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.",EAP
"Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels.",EAP
But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance.,EAP
"Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.",EAP
"It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow-collegians.",EAP
"Such, nevertheless, was the fact.",EAP
"And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main, if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed.",EAP
"Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson -- the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford -- him whose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy -- whose errors but inimitable whim -- whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance?",EAP
"I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning -- rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus -- his riches, too, as easily acquired.",EAP
"I soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill.",EAP
"I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with a gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my snares.",EAP
"At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design.",EAP
"To give to this a better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself.",EAP
"To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.",EAP
"We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist.",EAP
"The game, too, was my favorite �cart�.",EAP
"The rest of the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators.",EAP
"The parvenu, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether account.",EAP
"In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating -- he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes.",EAP
"With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply.",EAP
"The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils; in less than a single hour he had quadrupled his debt.",EAP
"For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful.",EAP
I say to my astonishment.,EAP
"Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him.",EAP
"That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.",EAP
What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.,EAP
"The pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound and unbroken silence was maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.",EAP
I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued.,EAP
"The wide, heavy, folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room.",EAP
"Their light, in dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, of about my own height, and closely muffled in a cloak.",EAP
"The darkness, however, was now total; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst.",EAP
"Before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.",EAP
"""Gentlemen,"" he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, ""Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving I am but fulfilling a duty.",EAP
"You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who has to-night won at �cart� a large sum of money from Lord Glendinning.",EAP
I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.,EAP
"Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.""",EAP
"While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor.",EAP
"In ceasing, he at once departed, and as abruptly as he had entered.",EAP
Can I -- shall I describe my sensations?,EAP
Must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned?,EAP
Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection.,EAP
"Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately reprocured.",EAP
"In the lining of my sleeve were found all of the court-cards essential in �cart�, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, fac-similes of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, arrond�es; the honors being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides.",EAP
"In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the breadth of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the length, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.",EAP
"Any outrageous burst of indignation upon this shameful discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure with which it was received.",EAP
"""Mr. Wilson,"" said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, ""Mr. Wilson, this is your property.""",EAP
"(The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.)",EAP
"""I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile), for any farther evidence of your skill.",EAP
Indeed we have had enough.,EAP
"You will see the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford -- at all events, of quitting, instantly, my chambers.""",EAP
"Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested, by a fact of the most startling character.",EAP
"The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say.",EAP
"Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious, to a degree of absurd coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature.",EAP
"When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every particular.",EAP
"The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself.",EAP
"Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston, placed it, unnoticed, over my own, left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance, and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.",EAP
I fled in vain.,EAP
"My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun.",EAP
Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns.,EAP
"Years flew, while I experienced no relief.",EAP
"-- at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition!",EAP
"At Vienna, too, at Berlin, and at Moscow!",EAP
"Where, in truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart?",EAP
"From his inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.",EAP
"And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I demand the questions ""Who is he?",EAP
-- whence came he?,EAP
"-- and what are his objects?""",EAP
But no answer was there found.,EAP
"And now I scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision.",EAP
But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture.,EAP
"It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions, which, fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter mischief.",EAP
"Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so imperiously assumed!",EAP
"Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!",EAP
"I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face.",EAP
"Be Wilson what he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly.",EAP
"Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton -- in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford -- in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge in Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt -- that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, I could fail to recognise the William Wilson of my schoolboy days -- the namesake, the companion, the rival, the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's?",EAP
-- But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama.,EAP
Thus far I had succumbed to this imperious domination.,EAP
"The sentiments of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his will.",EAP
"But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control.",EAP
I began to murmur -- to hesitate -- to resist.,EAP
"And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution?",EAP
"Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.",EAP
"It was at Rome, during the carnival of 18-- , that I attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio.",EAP
I had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance.,EAP
"The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking, let me not say with what unworthy motive, the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio.",EAP
"With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence.",EAP
"At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.",EAP
"In a perfect whirlwind of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar.",EAP
"He was attired, as I had expected, like myself; wearing a large Spanish cloak, and a mask of black silk which entirely covered his features.",EAP
"I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, ""scoundrel!",EAP
you shall not -- you shall not dog me unto death!,EAP
"Follow me, or I stab you where you stand,"" and I broke my way from the room into a small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.",EAP
"Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me.",EAP
"He staggered against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw.",EAP
"He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence.",EAP
The contest was brief indeed.,EAP
"I was frantic with every species of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and the power of a multitude.",EAP
"In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.",EAP
At this instant some person tried the latch of the door.,EAP
"I hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist.",EAP
"But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",EAP
"The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room.",EAP
"A large mirror, (so at first it appeared to me in my confusion), now stood where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced, with a feeble and tottering gait, to meet me.",EAP
"Thus it appeared, I say, but was not.",EAP
"It was my antagonist -- it was Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.",EAP
"Not thread in all the raiment -- not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of that face which was not, even identically, mine own!",EAP
"His mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them, upon the floor.",EAP
"It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper; and I could have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said -- ""You have conquered, and I yield.",EAP
Yet henceforward art thou also dead -- dead to the world and its hopes.,EAP
"In me didst thou exist -- and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.""",EAP
"WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism, its startling facts are now almost universally admitted.",EAP
"Of these latter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession � an unprofitable and disreputable tribe.",EAP
"There can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove, at the present day, that man, by mere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that, while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced.",EAP
I say that these � which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features � it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day.,EAP
My purpose at present is a very different one indeed.,EAP
"I am impelled, even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and myself.",EAP
"I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question, (Mr. Vankirk,) and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened.",EAP
"For many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.",EAP
"The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma.",EAP
"In spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night this had been attempted in vain.",EAP
"As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.",EAP
"""I sent for you to-night,"" he said, ""not so much to administer to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise.",EAP
I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the topic of the soul's immortality.,EAP
"I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of its own existence.",EAP
But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction.,EAP
With it my reason had nothing to do.,EAP
"All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than before.",EAP
I had been advised to study Cousin.,EAP
I studied him in his own works as well as in those of his European and American echoes.,EAP
"The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed in my hands.",EAP
I read it with profound attention.,EAP
"Throughout I found it logical, but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book.",EAP
In his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself.,EAP
"His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo.",EAP
"In short, I was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of France, and of Germany.",EAP
"Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no hold on the mind.",EAP
"Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things.",EAP
"The will may assent � the soul � the intellect, never.",EAP
"""I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed.",EAP
"But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two.",EAP
"I am enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.",EAP
"I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through its effect, into my normal condition.",EAP
"In sleep-waking, the reasoning and its conclusion � the cause and its effect � are present together.",EAP
"In my natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only partially, remains.",EAP
"""These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized.",EAP
"You have often observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker � the extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism.""",EAP
I consented of course to make this experiment.,EAP
A few passes threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep.,EAP
"His breathing became immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.",EAP
"The following conversation then ensued: � V. in the dialogue representing the patient, and P. myself.",EAP
P. Are you asleep ?,EAP
V. Yes � no I would rather sleep more soundly.,EAP
P. [After a few more passes.],EAP
Do you sleep now ?,EAP
P. How do you think your present illness will result ?,EAP
V. [After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort.],EAP
P. Does the idea of death afflict you ?,EAP
No � no !,EAP
P. Are you pleased with the prospect ?,EAP
"V. If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter.",EAP
The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.,EAP
"P. I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.",EAP
"V. I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel able to make.",EAP
You do not question me properly.,EAP
P. What then shall I ask ?,EAP
V. You must begin at the beginning.,EAP
P. The beginning !,EAP
but where is the beginning ?,EAP
V. You know that the beginning is GOD.,EAP
"[This was said in a low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration.]",EAP
P. What then is God ?,EAP
V. [Hesitating for many minutes.],EAP
P. Is not God spirit ?,EAP
"V. While I was awake I knew what you meant by ""spirit,"" but now it seems only a word � such for instance as truth, beauty � a quality, I mean.",EAP
P. Is not God immaterial ?,EAP
V. There is no immateriality � it is a mere word.,EAP
"That which is not matter, is not at all � unless qualities are things.",EAP
"P. Is God, then, material ?",EAP
[This reply startled me very much.],EAP
P. What then is he ?,EAP
"V. [After a long pause, and mutteringly.]",EAP
I see � but it is a thing difficult to tell.,EAP
"He is not spirit, for he exists.",EAP
"Nor is he matter, as you understand it.",EAP
"But there are gradations of matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser.",EAP
"The atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while the electric principle permeates the atmosphere.",EAP
"These gradations of matter increase in rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a matter unparticled � without particles � indivisible � one and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified.",EAP
"The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only permeates all things but impels all things � and thus is all things within itself.",EAP
This matter is God.,EAP
"What men attempt to embody in the word ""thought,"" is this matter in motion.",EAP
"P. The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.",EAP
V. Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea.,EAP
Motion is the action of mind � not of thinking.,EAP
"The unparticled matter, or God, in quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind.",EAP
"And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence; how I know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know.",EAP
"But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or quality, existing within itself, is thinking.",EAP
P. Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter ?,EAP
"V. The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses in gradation.",EAP
"We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous ether.",EAP
"Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether.",EAP
"When we reach the latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with nihility.",EAP
"The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight.",EAP
"Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity, or at least as matter.",EAP
For want of a better word we might term it spirit.,EAP
"Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether � conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass � an unparticled matter.",EAP
"For although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity.",EAP
"There will be a point � there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce.",EAP
"But the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit.",EAP
"It is clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before.",EAP
"The truth is, it is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to imagine what is not.",EAP
"When we flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.",EAP
"P. There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute coalescence; � and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space � a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in some degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton.",EAP
"We know that the resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their density.",EAP
Absolute coalescence is absolute density.,EAP
"Where there are no interspaces, there can be no yielding.",EAP
"An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.",EAP
V. Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.,EAP
"� As regards the progress of the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it.",EAP
"There is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend.",EAP
"The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand, about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb.",EAP
"In the one case, the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself � in the other it is endlessly accumulative.",EAP
P. But in all this � in this identification of mere matter with God � is there nothing of irreverence?,EAP
[I was forced to repeat this question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning.],EAP
V. Can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind?,EAP
"But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the very ""mind"" or ""spirit"" of the schools, so far as regards its high capacities, and is, moreover, the ""matter"" of these schools at the same time.",EAP
"God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of matter.",EAP
"P. You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is thought?",EAP
"V. In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind.",EAP
All created things are but the thoughts of God.,EAP
"P. You say, ""in general.""",EAP
The universal mind is God.,EAP
"For new individualities, matter is necessary.",EAP
"P. But you now speak of ""mind"" and ""matter"" as do the metaphysicians.",EAP
V. Yes � to avoid confusion.,EAP
"When I say ""mind,"" I mean the unparticled or ultimate matter; by ""matter"" I intend all else.",EAP
"P. You were saying that ""for new individualities matter is necessary.""",EAP
"V. Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God.",EAP
"To create individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions of the divine mind.",EAP
Thus man is individualized.,EAP
"Divested of corporate investiture, he were God.",EAP
"Now, the particular motion of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man ; as the motion of the whole is that of God.",EAP
P. You say that divested of the body man will be God?,EAP
V. [After much hesitation.],EAP
I could not have said this; it is an absurdity.,EAP
P. [Referring to my notes.],EAP
"You did say that ""divested of corporate investiture man were God.""",EAP
V. And this is true.,EAP
Man thus divested would be God � would be unindividualized.,EAP
But he can never be thus divested � at least never will be � else we must imagine an action of God returning upon itself � a purposeless and futile action.,EAP
Man is a creature.,EAP
Creatures are thoughts of God.,EAP
It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.,EAP
P. I do not comprehend.,EAP
You say that man will never put off the body?,EAP
V. I say that he will never be bodiless.,EAP
V. There are two bodies � the rudimental and the complete ; corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.,EAP
"What we call ""death,"" is but the painful metamorphosis.",EAP
"Our present incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary.",EAP
"Our future is perfected, ultimate, immortal.",EAP
The ultimate life is the full design.,EAP
P. But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.,EAP
"V. We, certainly � but not the worm.",EAP
"The matter of which our rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which the ultimate is composed.",EAP
"The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from the inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, as well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life.",EAP
P. You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death.,EAP
"V. When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly, without organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life.",EAP
"V. Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms.",EAP
"The organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one � the nature of the volition of God � that is to say, the motion of the unparticled matter.",EAP
You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain.,EAP
This it is not; but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is.,EAP
A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.,EAP
The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve.,EAP
"The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.",EAP
"The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the first undulation.",EAP
"This is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its organs.",EAP
"But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to this ether � in unison with it � the whole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it.",EAP
"It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life.",EAP
"To rudimental beings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.",EAP
"P. You speak of rudimental ""beings.""",EAP
Are there other rudimental thinking beings than man?,EAP
"V. The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebul�, planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebul�, suns, nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings.",EAP
"But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these.",EAP
"Each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures.",EAP
"In all, the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted.",EAP
"At death, or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life � immortality � and cognizant of all secrets but the one, act all things and pass everywhere by mere volition: � indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created � but that SPACE itself � that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows -- blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels.",EAP
"P. You say that ""but for the necessity of the rudimental life"" there would have been no stars.",EAP
But why this necessity?,EAP
"V. In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law � the Divine Volition.",EAP
"With the view of producing impediment, the organic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,) were contrived.",EAP
P. But again � why need this impediment have been produced?,EAP
V. The result of law inviolate is perfection � right � negative happiness.,EAP
"The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive pain.",EAP
"Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable.",EAP
"Thus pain, which in the inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.",EAP
P. But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?,EAP
V. All things are either good or bad by comparison.,EAP
"A sufficient analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of pain.",EAP
Positive pleasure is a mere idea.,EAP
To be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same.,EAP
Never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed.,EAP
"But it has been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic.",EAP
"The pain of the primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in Heaven.",EAP
"P. Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible to comprehend � ""the truly substantive vastness of infinity.""",EAP
"V. This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic conception of the term ""substance"" itself.",EAP
"We must not regard it as a quality, but as a sentiment: � it is the perception, in thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to their organization.",EAP
"There are many things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus � many things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all.",EAP
"But to the inorganic beings � to the angels � the whole of the unparticled matter is substance; that is to say, the whole of what we term ""space"" is to them the truest substantiality; � the stars, meantime, through what we consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes the organic.",EAP
"As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once.",EAP
"No sooner had I done this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired.",EAP
I noticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone.,EAP
His brow was of the coldness of ice.,EAP
"Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long pressure from Azrael's hand.",EAP
"Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the region of the shadows?",EAP
OF my country and of my family I have little to say.,EAP
"Ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the other.",EAP
"Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order, and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered up.",EAP
"Beyond all things the works of the German moralists gave me great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities.",EAP
I have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius --a deficiency of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime --and the Pyrrhonism of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious.,EAP
"Indeed a strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my mind with a very common error of this age --I mean the habit of referring occurrences, even the least susceptible of such reference, to the principles of that science.",EAP
"Upon the whole, no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition.",EAP
"I have thought proper to premise thus much lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity.",EAP
"After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18-- , from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands.",EAP
I went as passenger --having no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me like a fiend.,EAP
"Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons, copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak.",EAP
"She was freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands.",EAP
"We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium.",EAP
"The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank.",EAP
"We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood along the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound.",EAP
"One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular, isolated cloud, to the N. W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia.",EAP
"I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach.",EAP
"My notice was soon afterwards attracted by the duskyred appearance of the moon, and the peculiar character of the sea.",EAP
"The latter was undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed more than usually transparent.",EAP
"Although I could distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen fathoms.",EAP
"The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heated iron.",EAP
"As night came on, every breath of wind died away, and a more entire calm it is impossible to conceive.",EAP
"The flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration.",EAP
"However, as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger, and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go.",EAP
"No watch was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon deck.",EAP
I went below --not without a full presentiment of evil.,EAP
Indeed every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom.,EAP
"I told the captain my fears --but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to give a reply.",EAP
"My uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.",EAP
"As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled with a loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship quivering to its centre.",EAP
"In the next instant, a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern.",EAP
The extreme fury of the blast proved in a great measure the salvation of the ship.,EAP
"Although completely water-logged, yet, as all her masts had gone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally righted.",EAP
"By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say.",EAP
"Stunned by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in between the stern-post and rudder.",EAP
"With great difficulty I gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of our being among breakers, so terrific beyond the wildest imagination was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed.",EAP
"After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port.",EAP
"I hallooed to him with all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft.",EAP
We soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident.,EAP
"All on deck, with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard, and the captain and mates must have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged with water.",EAP
"Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down.",EAP
"Our cable had, of course, parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed.",EAP
"We scudded with frightful velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us.",EAP
"The frame-work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received considerable injury --but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast.",EAP
"The main fury of the Simoom had already blown over, and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind --but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay, well believing, that, in our shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue.",EAP
But this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified.,EAP
"For five entire days and nights --during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the forecastle --the hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest I had before encountered.",EAP
"Our course for the first four days was, with trifling variations, S. E. and by South; and we must have run down the coast of New Holland.",EAP
"On the fifth day the cold became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the northward.",EAP
"The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a very few degrees above the horizon --emitting no decisive light.",EAP
"There were no clouds whatever apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury.",EAP
"About noon, as nearly as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun.",EAP
"It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow unaccompanied by any ray.",EAP
"Just before sinking within the turgid sea its central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power.",EAP
"It was a dim, silver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.",EAP
"We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day --that day to me has not arrived --to the Swede, never did arrive.",EAP
"Thenceforward we were enshrouded in pitchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship.",EAP
"Eternal night continued to envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics.",EAP
"We observed too, that, although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto attended us.",EAP
"All around was horror, and thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony.",EAP
"Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder.",EAP
"We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and securing ourselves as well as possible to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into the world of ocean.",EAP
"We had no means of calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation.",EAP
"We were, however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators, and felt extreme amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice.",EAP
In the meantime every moment threatened to be our last --every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us.,EAP
"The swell surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle.",EAP
"My companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship --but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling.",EAP
"At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the Albatross --at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the Kraken.",EAP
"We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night.",EAP
"--cried he, shrieking in my ears, -- ""Almighty God!",EAP
"As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck.",EAP
"Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood.",EAP
"At a terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of nearly four thousand tons.",EAP
"Although upreared upon the summit of a wave of more than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size still exceeded that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence.",EAP
"Her huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship.",EAP
"A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed off from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging.",EAP
"But what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane.",EAP
"When we first discovered her, her stupendous bows were alone to be seen, as she rose up, like a demon of the deep, slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her.",EAP
"For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and --came down.",EAP
"At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my spirit.",EAP
"Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm.",EAP
"Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea.",EAP
"The shock of the descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me with irresistible violence upon the rigging of the stranger.",EAP
"As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about, and to the confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew.",EAP
"With little difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold.",EAP
Why I did so I can hardly tell.,EAP
"A nameless and indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was perhaps the principle of my concealment.",EAP
"I was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I had taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension.",EAP
I therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold.,EAP
This I did by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship.,EAP
"I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it.",EAP
A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait.,EAP
"I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance.",EAP
There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity.,EAP
"His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame quivered under the burthen.",EAP
"He muttered to himself, in a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation.",EAP
"His manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of a god.",EAP
"He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more.",EAP
"* * * * * * A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul -- a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of by-gone time are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself will offer me no key.",EAP
To a mind constituted like my own the latter consideration is an evil.,EAP
"I shall never, -- I know that I shall never -- be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions.",EAP
"Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel.",EAP
"A new sense, a new entity is added to my soul.",EAP
"It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus.",EAP
"Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they pass me by unnoticed.",EAP
"Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the people will not see.",EAP
"It was but just now that I passed directly before the eyes of the mate, -- it was no long while ago that I ventured into the captain's own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which I write, and have written.",EAP
I shall from time to time continue this journal.,EAP
"It is true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will not fail to make the endeavor.",EAP
"At the last moment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.",EAP
An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation.,EAP
Are such things the operations of ungoverned Chance?,EAP
"I had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl.",EAP
"While musing upon the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel.",EAP
"The studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.",EAP
I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel.,EAP
"Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war.",EAP
"Her rigging, build, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this kind.",EAP
"What she is not I can easily perceive, what she is I fear it is impossible to say.",EAP
"I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvass, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.",EAP
I have been looking at the timbers of the ship.,EAP
She is built of a material to which I am a stranger.,EAP
There is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied.,EAP
"I mean its extreme porousness, considered independently of the wormeaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age.",EAP
"It will appear perhaps an observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood has every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended or swelled by any unnatural means.",EAP
In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection.,EAP
"""It is as sure,"" he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, ""as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman.""",EAP
"About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew.",EAP
"They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence.",EAP
"Like the one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age.",EAP
"Their knees trembled with infirmity, their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude, their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind, their voices were low, tremulous, and broken, their eyes glistened with the rheum of years, and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest.",EAP
Around them on every part of the deck lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction.,EAP
I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail.,EAP
"From that period the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has held her terrific course due south, with every rag of canvass packed upon her from her trucks to her lower-studding-sail booms, and rolling every moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of man to imagine.",EAP
"I have just left the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience.",EAP
It appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not buried up at once and forever.,EAP
"We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of Eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss.",EAP
"From billows a thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy.",EAP
I am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effect.,EAP
"I must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current, or impetuous under-tow.",EAP
"I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin -- but, as I expected, he paid me no attention.",EAP
"Although in his appearance there is, to a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man --still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which I regarded him.",EAP
"In stature he is nearly my own height, that is, about five feet eight inches.",EAP
"He is of a well-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably otherwise.",EAP
"But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the face, it is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age so utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense --a sentiment ineffable.",EAP
"His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.",EAP
"His gray hairs are records of the past, and his grayer eyes are sybils of the future.",EAP
"The cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts.",EAP
"His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored with a fiery unquiet eye over a paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore the signature of a monarch.",EAP
"He muttered to himself, as did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue, and although the speaker was close at my elbow, yet his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.",EAP
The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld.,EAP
"The crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries, their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning, and when their figures fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battle-latterns, I feel as I have never felt before, although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin.",EAP
When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions.,EAP
"If I trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective!",EAP
"All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe.",EAP
"As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract.",EAP
"To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly impossible --yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death.",EAP
"It is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge --some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction.",EAP
Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself --it must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor.,EAP
"The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step, but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair.",EAP
"In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and as we carry a crowd of canvass, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea --Oh, horror upon horror!",EAP
"the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance.",EAP
"But little time will be left me to ponder upon my destiny --the circles rapidly grow small --we are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool --and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and shrieking of ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering, oh God!",EAP
"""CON tal que las costumbres de un autor,"" says Don Thomas de las Torres, in the preface to his ""Amatory Poems"" ""sean puras y castas, importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras"" -- meaning, in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books.",EAP
We presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion.,EAP
"It would be a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there until his ""Amatory Poems"" get out of print, or are laid definitely upon the shelf through lack of readers.",EAP
"Every fiction should have a moral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every fiction has.",EAP
"Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon the ""Batrachomyomachia,"" and proved that the poet's object was to excite a distaste for sedition.",EAP
"Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and drinking.",EAP
"Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.",EAP
Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute.,EAP
"These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in ""The Antediluvians,"" a parable in Powhatan,"" new views in ""Cock Robin,"" and transcendentalism in ""Hop O' My Thumb.""",EAP
"In short, it has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound design.",EAP
Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared.,EAP
"A novelist, for example, need have no care of his moral.",EAP
"It is there -- that is to say, it is somewhere -- and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.",EAP
"When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the ""Dial,"" or the ""Down-Easter,"" together with all that he ought to have intended, and the rest that he clearly meant to intend: -- so that it will all come very straight in the end.",EAP
"There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by certain ignoramuses -- that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more precise words, a tale with a moral.",EAP
"They are not the critics predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals: -- that is the secret.",EAP
"By and by the ""North American Quarterly Humdrum"" will make them ashamed of their stupidity.",EAP
"In the meantime, by way of staying execution -- by way of mitigating the accusations against me -- I offer the sad history appended, -- a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form the title of the tale.",EAP
"I should have credit for this arrangement -- a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.",EAP
"Defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction -- even if the dead in question be nothing but dead small beer.",EAP
"It is not my design, therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit.",EAP
"He was a sad dog, it is true, and a dog's death it was that he died; but he himself was not to blame for his vices.",EAP
They grew out of a personal defect in his mother.,EAP
"She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant -- for duties to her well -- regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better for beating -- but, poor woman!",EAP
"she had the misfortune to be left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged.",EAP
The world revolves from right to left.,EAP
It will not do to whip a baby from left to right.,EAP
"If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks its quota of wickedness in.",EAP
"I was often present at Toby's chastisements, and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was getting worse and worse every day.",EAP
"At last I saw, through the tears in my eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made prophecy of his ruin.",EAP
The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful.,EAP
At five months of age he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate.,EAP
"At six months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards.",EAP
At seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.,EAP
At eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance pledge.,EAP
"Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.",EAP
"Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last.",EAP
"The fashion had ""grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength,"" so that, when he came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition to gamble.",EAP
Not that he actually laid wagers -- no.,EAP
I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs.,EAP
With him the thing was a mere formula -- nothing more.,EAP
His expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever.,EAP
They were simple if not altogether innocent expletives -- imaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence.,EAP
"When he said ""I'll bet you so and so,"" nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty to put him down.",EAP
"The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him.",EAP
It was a vulgar one- this I begged him to believe.,EAP
It was discountenanced by society -- here I said nothing but the truth.,EAP
It was forbidden by act of Congress -- here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.,EAP
I remonstrated -- but to no purpose.,EAP
I demonstrated -- in vain.,EAP
I entreated -- he smiled.,EAP
I implored -- he laughed.,EAP
I preached- he sneered.,EAP
I threatened -- he swore.,EAP
I kicked him -- he called for the police.,EAP
"I pulled his nose -- he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.",EAP
Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of Dammit's mother had entailed upon her son.,EAP
"He was detestably poor, and this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn.",EAP
"I will not be bound to say that I ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as ""I'll bet you a dollar.""",EAP
"It was usually ""I'll bet you what you please,"" or ""I'll bet you what you dare,"" or ""I'll bet you a trifle,"" or else, more significantly still, ""I'll bet the Devil my head.""",EAP
This latter form seemed to please him best; -- perhaps because it involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.,EAP
"Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been small too.",EAP
But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure that I am right in attributing them to him.,EAP
"At all events the phrase in question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his brains like bank-notes: -- but this was a point which my friend's perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.",EAP
"In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to ""I'll bet the Devil my head,"" with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me.",EAP
I am always displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account.,EAP
"Mysteries force a man to think, and so injure his health.",EAP
"The truth is, there was something in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression -- something in his manner of enunciation -- which at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy -- something which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.",EAP
I began not to like it at all.,EAP
Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state.,EAP
I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it.,EAP
"I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the toad, -- that is to say, ""awaken him to a sense of his situation.""",EAP
I addressed myself to the task forthwith.,EAP
Once more I betook myself to remonstrance.,EAP
Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at expostulation.,EAP
"When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some very equivocal behavior.",EAP
"For some moments he remained silent, merely looking me inquisitively in the face.",EAP
"But presently he threw his head to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent.",EAP
Then he spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders.,EAP
Then he winked with the right eye.,EAP
Then he repeated the operation with the left.,EAP
Then he shut them both up very tight.,EAP
Then he opened them both so very wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.,EAP
"Then, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers.",EAP
"Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.",EAP
I can call to mind only the beads of his discourse.,EAP
He would be obliged to me if I would hold my tongue.,EAP
He wished none of my advice.,EAP
He despised all my insinuations.,EAP
He was old enough to take care of himself.,EAP
Did I still think him baby Dammit?,EAP
Did I mean to say any thing against his character?,EAP
Did I intend to insult him?,EAP
Was I a fool?,EAP
"Was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?",EAP
"He would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself to abide by my reply.",EAP
Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother knew that I was out.,EAP
"My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.",EAP
Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder.,EAP
"Turning upon his heel, he left my presence with undignified precipitation.",EAP
It was well for him that he did so.,EAP
My feelings had been wounded.,EAP
Even my anger had been aroused.,EAP
For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager.,EAP
"I would have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit's little head -- for the fact is, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.",EAP
But Khoda shefa midehed -- Heaven gives relief -- as the Mussulmans say when you tread upon their toes.,EAP
"It was in pursuance of my duty that I had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man.",EAP
"It now seemed to me, however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself.",EAP
"But although I forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up his society altogether.",EAP
"I even went so far as to humor some of his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes: -- so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.",EAP
"* * * * * * * One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us in the direction of a river.",EAP
"There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross it.",EAP
"It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark.",EAP
"As we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits.",EAP
"Not so upon those of the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped.",EAP
He seemed to be in an unusual good humor.,EAP
He was excessively lively -- so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion.,EAP
It is not impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals.,EAP
"I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of the ""Dial"" present.",EAP
"I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself.",EAP
"Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the time.",EAP
I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.,EAP
"At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height.",EAP
"Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual.",EAP
But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit.,EAP
"He insisted upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air.",EAP
"Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do.",EAP
"The best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by Toby Dammit.",EAP
"I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a braggadocio, and could not do what he said.",EAP
For this I had reason to be sorry afterward; -- for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head that he could.,EAP
"I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation ""ahem!""",EAP
"I started, and looked about me in surprise.",EAP
"My glance at length fell into a nook of the frame -- work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect.",EAP
"Nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl's.",EAP
"His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.",EAP
"Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very odd.",EAP
"Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a circumstance, he interrupted me with a second ""ahem!""",EAP
To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply.,EAP
"The fact is, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable.",EAP
"I have known a Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word ""Fudge!""",EAP
"I am not ashamed to say, therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.",EAP
"""Dammit,"" said I, ""what are you about?",EAP
"-- the gentleman says 'ahem!'""",EAP
"I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him; for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool.",EAP
"""Dammit,"" observed I -- although this sounded very much like an oath, than which nothing was further from my thoughts -- ""Dammit,"" I suggested -- ""the gentleman says 'ahem!'""",EAP
"I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or knocked him in the head with the ""Poets and Poetry of America,"" he could hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those simple words: ""Dammit, what are you about?- don't you hear?",EAP
"-- the gentleman says 'ahem!'""",EAP
"""You don't say so?""",EAP
"gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war.",EAP
"""Are you quite sure he said that?",EAP
"Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may as well put a bold face upon the matter.",EAP
"Here goes, then -- ahem!""",EAP
At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased -- God only knows why.,EAP
"He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.",EAP
"""I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,"" said he, with the frankest of all smiles, ""but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of mere form.""",EAP
"replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down the corners of his mouth -- ""ahem!""",EAP
"said he again, after a pause; and not another word more than ""ahem!""",EAP
did I ever know him to say after that.,EAP
"thought I, without expressing myself aloud -- ""this is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion.",EAP
One extreme induces another.,EAP
I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture?,EAP
"At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.""",EAP
"here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and looking like a very old sheep in a revery.",EAP
"The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade of the bridge -- a few paces back from the turnstile.",EAP
"""My good fellow,"" said he, ""I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run.",EAP
"Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don't omit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing.",EAP
"A mere form, you know.",EAP
"I will say 'one, two, three, and away.'",EAP
"Mind you, start at the word 'away'"" Here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look at Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon- One -- two -- three -- and -- away!",EAP
"Punctually at the word ""away,"" my poor friend set off in a strong gallop.",EAP
"The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord's -- nor yet very low, like that of Mr. Lord's reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would clear it.",EAP
And then what if he did not?,EAP
"-- ah, that was the question -- what if he did not?",EAP
"""What right,"" said I, ""had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump?",EAP
The little old dot-and-carry-one!,EAP
"If he asks me to jump, I won't do it, that's flat, and I don't care who the devil he is.""",EAP
"The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times -- an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last words of my remark.",EAP
"But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an instant.",EAP
"In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had taken the leap.",EAP
"I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.",EAP
"I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over.",EAP
"But the whole leap was the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the stile from which he had started.",EAP
"At the same instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile.",EAP
"At all this I was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my assistance.",EAP
I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury.,EAP
"The truth is, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the homoeopathists.",EAP
"In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once.",EAP
"About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.",EAP
With the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.,EAP
He did not long survive his terrible loss.,EAP
"The homoeopathists did not give him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated to take.",EAP
"So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers.",EAP
"I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.",EAP
"The scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for dog's meat.",EAP
"""LA MUSIQUE,"" says Marmontel, in those ""Contes Moraux""* which in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling ""Moral Tales,"" as if in mockery of their spirit -- ""la musique est le seul des talents qui jouissent de lui-meme; tous les autres veulent des temoins.""",EAP
He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them.,EAP
"No more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise.",EAP
And it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude.,EAP
"The idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone.",EAP
"The proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses.",EAP
But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one -- which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion.,EAP
I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery.,EAP
"In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory.",EAP
"To me, at least, the presence -- not of human life only, but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless -- is a stain upon the landscape -- is at war with the genius of the scene.",EAP
"I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all, -- I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole -- a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain -- a being which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.",EAP
"* Moraux is here derived from moeurs, and its meaning is ""fashionable"" or more strictly ""of manners.""",EAP
"Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand -- notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood -- that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty.",EAP
"The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies.",EAP
"The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter; -- while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged.",EAP
"Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it.",EAP
"And since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle -- indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the operations of Deity, -- it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august.",EAP
"As we find cycle within cycle without end, -- yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine?",EAP
"In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast ""clod of the valley"" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation.",EAP

"My wanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim, deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and gazed alone.",EAP
"What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, ""la solitude est une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose?""",EAP
The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.,EAP
"It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all -- that I chanced upon a certain rivulet and island.",EAP
"I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I contemplated the scene.",EAP
I felt that thus only should I look upon it -- such was the character of phantasm which it wore.,EAP
"On all sides -- save to the west, where the sun was about sinking -- arose the verdant walls of the forest.",EAP
"The little river which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east -- while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.",EAP
"About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.",EAP
"So blended bank and shadow there That each seemed pendulous in air -- so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began.",EAP
My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked difference in their aspects.,EAP
The latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties.,EAP
"It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers.",EAP
"The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed.",EAP
"The trees were lithe, mirthful, erect -- bright, slender, and graceful, -- of eastern figure and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored.",EAP
"There seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from out the heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.",EAP
* * Florem putares nare per liquidum aethera.,EAP
The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.,EAP
"A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things.",EAP
"The trees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude, wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.",EAP
"The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered.",EAP
"The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness.",EAP
"I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed.",EAP
"This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I lost myself forthwith in revery.",EAP
"""If ever island were enchanted,"" said I to myself, ""this is it.",EAP
This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race.,EAP
Are these green tombs theirs?,EAP
-- or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own?,EAP
"In dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God, little by little, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution?",EAP
"What the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?""",EAP
"As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the sycamore-flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased, while I thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island.",EAP
"She stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar.",EAP
"While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed indicative of joy -- but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade.",EAP
"Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light.",EAP
"""The revolution which has just been made by the Fay,"" continued I, musingly, ""is the cycle of the brief year of her life.",EAP
She has floated through her winter and through her summer.,EAP
"She is a year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the dark water, making its blackness more black.""",EAP
"And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.",EAP
"She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness.",EAP
"And again and again she made the circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more black.",EAP
"But at length when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over an things and I beheld her magical figure no more.",EAP
"SUN OFFICE April 13, 10 o'clock A.M. ================================== ASTOUNDING NEWS!",EAP
BY EXPRESS VIA NORFOLK: --------------- THE ATLANTIC CROSSED IN THREE DAYS!,EAP
--------------- SIGNAL TRIUMPH OF MR. MONCK MASON'S FLYING MACHINE!!!,EAP
"--------------- Arrival at Sullivan's Island, near Charlestown, S. C., of Mr. Mason, Mr. Robert Hol- land, Mr. Henson, Mr. Har- rison Ainsworth, and four others, in the mm.",EAP
"STEERING BALLOON ""VICTORIA,"" AFTER A PASSAGE OF SEVENTY-FIVE HOURS FROM LAND TO LAND.",EAP
--------------- FULL PARTICULARS OF THE VOYAGE!!!,EAP
--------------- The great problem is at length solved.,EAP
"The air, as well as the earth and the ocean, has been subdued by science, and will become a common and convenient highway for mankind.",EAP
The Atlantic has been actually crossed in a Balloon; and this too without difficulty -- without any great apparent danger -- with thorough control of the machine -- and in the inconceivably brief period of seventy-five hours from shore to shore!,EAP
"By the energy of an agent at Charleston, S.C., we are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage, which was performed between Saturday, the 6th instant, at 11, A.M., and 2, P.M., on Tuesday the 9th inst.",EAP
": by Sir Everard Bringhurst; Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck's; Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known aeronauts; Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, author of ""Jack Sheppard,"" &c.; and Mr. Henson, the projector of the late unsuccessful flying machine -- with two seamen from Woolwich -- in all, eight persons.",EAP
"The particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect, as, with slight exception, they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself, its construction, and other matters of interest.",EAP
"The only alteration in the MS. received, has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a connected and intelligible form.",EAP
"Two very decided failures, of late -- those of Mr. Henson and Sir George Cayley -- had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation.",EAP
"Mr. Henson's scheme (which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science,) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill.",EAP
"But, in all the experiments made with models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight.",EAP
"The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they were in motion -- a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility; and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the sustaining power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend.",EAP
"This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support -- in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice.",EAP
He exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution.,EAP
"The propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution.",EAP
"These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power.",EAP
The whole project was thus a complete failure.,EAP
"It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover to Weilburg in the balloon, ""Nassau"", occasioned so much excitement in 1837,) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the air -- rightly attributing the failure of Mr. Henson's scheme, and of Sir George Cayley's, to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes.",EAP
"He made the first public experiment at Willis's Rooms, but afterward removed his model to the Adelaide Gallery.",EAP
"Like Sir George Cayley's balloon, his own was an ellipsoid.",EAP
"Its length was 13 feet 6 inches -- height, 6 feet 8 inches.",EAP
"It contained about 320 cubic feet of gas, which, if pure hydrogen, would support 21 pounds upon its first inflation, before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape.",EAP
The weight of the whole machine and apparatus was 17 pounds -- leaving about 4 pounds to spare.,EAP
"Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light wood, about 9 feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the customary manner.",EAP
From this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car.,EAP
"The mode of arrangement of the rudder and of the Archimedean screw, will be best shown in the annexed engraving, which we have kindly been permitted to use.",EAP
"The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, 18 inches in length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at 15 degrees, pass a series of steel wire radii, 2 feet long, and thus projecting a foot on either side.",EAP
"These radii are connected at the outer extremities by 2 bands of flattened wire -- the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface.",EAP
At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop.,EAP
In the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve.,EAP
"From the end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car.",EAP
"By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole.",EAP
"By means of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction.",EAP
"The spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of raising 45 pounds upon a barrel of 4 inches diameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound up.",EAP
"It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces.",EAP
"The rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a battledoor, and was about 3 feet long, and at the widest, one foot.",EAP
Its weight was about 2 ounces.,EAP
"It could be turned flat, and directed upwards or downwards, as well as to the right or left; and thus enabled the aeronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he might desire to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction.",EAP
"This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner,) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery, where it accomplished a velocity of 5 miles per hour; although, strange to say, it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of Mr. Henson -- so resolute is the world to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity.",EAP
"To accomplish the great desideratum of aerial navigation, it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in dynamics.",EAP
"So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate success of his invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible, a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extent -- the original design being to cross the British Channel, as before, in the Nassau balloon.",EAP
"To carry out his views, he solicited and obtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of aerostation.",EAP
"The project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the public -- the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine, which was built (under the superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne,) at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in Wales.",EAP
"Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted to a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last -- when the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure.",EAP
"We are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party -- but, in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage.",EAP
"The balloon (an ellipsoid as represented in our engraving of the model) is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc.",EAP
"It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when fully inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about 2500 pounds.",EAP
"The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily procured and managed.",EAP
"For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we are indebted to Mr. Charles Green.",EAP
"Up to his discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain.",EAP
"Two, and even three days, have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere.",EAP
"In a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coal-gas unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks.",EAP
"The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them -- by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if it should be judged prudent to do so.",EAP
"All these articles, with the exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop overhead.",EAP
"The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one appended to the model.",EAP
"It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully strong, for so frail looking a machine.",EAP
Its rim is about 4 feet deep.,EAP
"The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller.",EAP
"The balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of the most indispensable importance.",EAP
"A few words, in explanation, will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation.",EAP
"As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power.",EAP
"For example, there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even, of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the machine may descend.",EAP
"This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk, the whole will again rapidly ascend.",EAP
"To check this ascent, the only recourse is, (or rather was, until Mr. Green's invention of the guide-rope,) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in the loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth.",EAP
This was the great obstacle to voyages of length.,EAP
The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable.,EAP
"It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree.",EAP
"If, for example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary.",EAP
"If, on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth.",EAP
"Thus, the balloon can neither ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired.",EAP
"When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water.",EAP
"These float, and serve all the purposes of the mere rope on land.",EAP
"Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the direction of the balloon.",EAP
"The rope drags, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is made : a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of two objects, will always indicate the course.",EAP
"In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates the velocity.",EAP
"When there is no angle -- in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse.",EAP
"As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent, specifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau voyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office : unexpected events, however, rendered these passports superfluous.",EAP
"The inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak, on Saturday morning, the 6th instant, in the Court-Yard of Weal-Vor House, Mr. Osborne's seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7 minutes past 11, every thing being ready for departure, the balloon was set free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no use being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the rudder.",EAP
"We proceed now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth from the joint MSS.",EAP
"of Mr. Monck Mason, and Mr. Ainsworth.",EAP
"The body of the journal, as given, is in the hand-writing of Mr. Mason, and a P. S. is appended, each day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in preparation, and will shortly give the public a more minute, and no doubt, a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage.",EAP
"Saturday, April the 6th.",EAP
"-- Every preparation likely to embarrass us, having been made over night, we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak; but owing to a thick fog, which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before nearly eleven o'clock.",EAP
"Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction of the Bristol Channel.",EAP
"Found the ascending force greater than we had expected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and more in the sun's rays, our ascent became very rapid.",EAP
"I did not wish, however, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so concluded to ascend for the present.",EAP
"We soon ran out our guide-rope; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very rapidly.",EAP
"The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully.",EAP
"In about 10 minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet.",EAP
"The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the subjacent country -- a most romantic one when seen from any point, -- was now especially sublime.",EAP
"The numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they were filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in inextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of eastern fable.",EAP
We were rapidly approaching the mountains in the South; but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety.,EAP
"In a few minutes we soared over them in fine style; and Mr. Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly a dead level.",EAP
"At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen minutes afterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea.",EAP
"We now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys affixed, into the water.",EAP
"This was immediately done, and we commenced a gradual descent.",EAP
"In about 20 minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the touch of the second soon afterwards, we remained stationary as to elevation.",EAP
"We were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we put them both into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris.",EAP
"By means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired.",EAP
"Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and dropped in the sea a bottle, enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention.",EAP
"Hardly, however, had we done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree.",EAP
"The steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car end, (by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up,) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach, from the pivot of the axis of the screw.",EAP
"While we were endeavoring to regain it, our attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong current of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing force, towards the Atlantic.",EAP
"We soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less, certainly, than 50 or 60 miles an hour, so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some 40 miles to our North, before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about.",EAP
"It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary, but to my fancy, a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he was instantly seconded by Mr. Holland -- viz.",EAP
": that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America.",EAP
"After slight reflection I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which (strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only.",EAP
"As the stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely upon our course.",EAP
"We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea.",EAP
"We perceived the effect of this manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress and, as the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the ide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel.",EAP
It is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast.,EAP
"We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of which were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to.",EAP
"We occasioned the greatest excitement on board all -- an excitement greatly relished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or fear, to the wind.",EAP
Many of the vessels fired signal guns; some displayed flags and in all we were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising distinctness) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs.,EAP
"We kept on in this manner throughout the day, with no material incident, and, as the shades of night closed around us, we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed.",EAP
"It could not have been less than 500 miles, and was probably much more.",EAP
"The propeller was kept in constant operation, and, no doubt, aided our progress materially.",EAP
"As the sun went down, the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence.",EAP
"The wind was from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of success.",EAP
"We suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down, and by means of cloaks and a few blankets, we did sufficiently well.",EAP
The last nine hours have been unquestionably the most exciting of my life.,EAP
I can conceive nothing more sublimating than the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this.,EAP
May God grant that we succeed !,EAP
"I ask not success for mere safety to my insignificant person, but for the sake of human knowledge and -- for the vastness of the triumph.",EAP
And yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder is why men have scrupled to attempt it before.,EAP
"One single gale such as now befriends us -- let such a tempest whirl forward a balloon for 4 or 5 days (these gales often last longer) and the voyager will be easily borne, in that period, from coast to coast.",EAP
In view of such a gale the broad Atlantic becomes a mere lake.,EAP
"I am more struck, just now, with the supreme silence which reigns in the sea beneath us, notwithstanding its agitation, than with any other phenomenon presenting itself.",EAP
The waters give up no voice to the heavens.,EAP
The immense flaming ocean writhes and is tortured uncomplainingly.,EAP
The mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony.,EAP
"In a night such as is this to me, a man lives -- lives a whole century of ordinary life -- nor would I forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence.",EAP
"[Mr. Mason's MS.] This morning the gale, by 10, had subsided to an eight or nine -- knot breeze, (for a vessel at sea,) and bears us, perhaps, 30 miles per hour, or more.",EAP
"It has veered, however, very considerably to the north; and now, at sundown, we are holding our course due west, principally by the screw and rudder, which answer their purposes to admiration.",EAP
"I regard the project as thoroughly successful, and the easy navigation of the air in any direction (not exactly in the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical.",EAP
"We could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday; but, by ascending, we might have got out of its influence, if requisite.",EAP
"Against a pretty stiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our way with the propeller.",EAP
"At noon, to-day, ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet (about the height of Cotopaxi), by discharging ballast.",EAP
"Did this to search for a more direct current, but found none so favorable as the one we are now in.",EAP
"We have an abundance of gas to take us across this small pond, even should the voyage last 3 weeks.",EAP
I have not the slightest fear for the result.,EAP
The difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended.,EAP
"I can choose my current, and should I find all currents against me, I can make very tolerable headway with the propeller.",EAP
We have had no incidents worth recording.,EAP
The night promises fair.,EAP
"I have little to record, except the fact (to me quite a surprising one) that, at an elevation equal to that of Cotopaxi, I experienced neither very intense cold, nor headache, nor difficulty of breathing; neither, I find, did Mr. Mason, nor Mr. Holland, nor Sir Everard.",EAP
Mr. Osborne complained of constriction of the chest -- but this soon wore off.,EAP
"We have flown at a great rate during the day, and we must be more than half way across the Atlantic.",EAP
"We have passed over some 20 or 30 vessels of various kinds, and all seem to be delightfully astonished.",EAP
Crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a feat after all.,EAP
Omne ignotum pro magnifico.,EAP
"Mem : at 25,000 feet elevation the sky appears nearly black, and the stars are distinctly visible; while the sea does not seem convex (as one might suppose) but absolutely and most unequivocally concave.",EAP
"* Monday, the 8th.",EAP
"[Mr. Mason's MS.] This morning we had again some little trouble with the rod of the propeller, which must be entirely remodelled, for fear of serious accident -- I mean the steel rod -- not the vanes.",EAP
The latter could not be improved.,EAP
The wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the north-east all day and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us.,EAP
"Just before day, we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon, accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine.",EAP
"These phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in the atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night.",EAP
Threw down several bottles to the vessels below.,EAP
Saw one of them picked up by a large ship -- seemingly one of the New York line packets.,EAP
"Endeavored to make out her name, but could not be sure of it.",EAP
"Mr. Osbornes telescope made it out something like ""Atalanta.""",EAP
"It is now 12 ,at night, and we are still going nearly west, at a rapid pace.",EAP
The sea is peculiarly phosphorescent.,EAP
"It is now 2, A.M., and nearly calm, as well as I can judge -- but it is very difficult to determine this point, since we move with the air so completely.",EAP
The vanes are working admirably.,EAP
"I have not slept since quitting Wheal-Vor, but can stand it no longer, and must take a nap.",EAP
We cannot be far from the American coast.,EAP
"[Mr. Ainsworth's MS.] One, P.M. We are in full view of the low coast of South Carolina.",EAP
The great problem is accomplished.,EAP
We have crossed the Atlantic -- fairly and easily crossed it in a balloon !,EAP
God be praised !,EAP
Who shall say that anything is impossible hereafter?,EAP
--------------- The Journal here ceases.,EAP
"Some particulars of the descent were communicated, however, by Mr. Ainsworth to Mr. Forsyth.",EAP
"It was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast, which was immediately recognized by both the seamen, and by Mr. Osborne.",EAP
"The latter gentleman having acquaintances at Fort Moultrie, it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity.",EAP
"The balloon was brought over the beach (the tide being out and the sand hard, smooth, and admirably adapted for a descent,) and the grapnel let go, which took firm hold at once.",EAP
"The inhabitants of the island, and of the fort, thronged out, of course, to see the balloon; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyage -- the crossing of the Atlantic.",EAP
"The grapnel caught at 2, P.M., precisely; and thus the whole voyage was completed in 75 hours; or rather less, counting from shore to shore.",EAP
No serious accident occurred.,EAP
No real danger was at any time apprehended.,EAP
"The balloon was exhausted and secured without trouble; and when the MS. from which this narrative is compiled was despatched from Charleston, the party were still at Fort Moultrie.",EAP
"Their farther intentions were not ascertained; but we can safely promise our readers some additional information either on Monday or in the course of the next day, at farthest.",EAP
"This is unquestionably the most stupendous, the most interesting, and the most important undertaking, ever accomplished or even attempted by man.",EAP
"What magnificent events may ensue, it would be useless now to think of determining.",EAP
"-- Mr. Ainsworth has not attempted to account for this phenomenon, which, however, is quite susceptible of explanation.",EAP
"A line dropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet, perpendicularly to the surface of the earth (or sea), would form the perpendicular of a right-angled triangle, of which the base would extend from the right angle to the horizon, and the hypothenuse from the horizon to the balloon.",EAP
"But the 25,000 feet of altitude is little or nothing, in comparison with the extent of prospect.",EAP
"In other words, the base and hypothenuse of the supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular, that the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel.",EAP
In this manner the horizon of the aeronaut would appear to be on a level with the car.,EAP
"But, as the point immediately beneath him seems, and is, at a great distance below him, it seems, of course, also, at a great distance below the horizon.",EAP
"Hence the impression of concavity; and this impression must remain, until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to the extent of prospect, that the apparent parallelism of the base and hypothenuse disappears -- when the earth's real convexity must appear.",EAP
"IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses -- of the prima mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them.",EAP
"In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have all overlooked it.",EAP
"We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want of belief -- of faith; -- whether it be faith in Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala.",EAP
"The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its supererogation.",EAP
We saw no need of the impulse -- for the propensity.,EAP
We could not perceive its necessity.,EAP
"We could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself; -- we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal.",EAP
"It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori.",EAP
"The intellectual or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs -- to dictate purposes to God.",EAP
"Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind.",EAP
"In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man should eat.",EAP
"We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness, and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating.",EAP
"Secondly, having settled it to be God's will that man should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness, forthwith.",EAP
"And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness, -- so, in short, with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect.",EAP
"And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.",EAP
"It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do.",EAP
"If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into being?",EAP
"If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?",EAP
"Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something, which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term.",EAP
"In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motive not motivirt.",EAP
"Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not.",EAP
"In theory, no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong.",EAP
"With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible.",EAP
"I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us, and alone impels us to its prosecution.",EAP
"Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements.",EAP
"It is a radical, a primitive impulse-elementary.",EAP
"It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology.",EAP
But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea.,EAP
"The phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence.",EAP
It is our safeguard against injury.,EAP
Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development.,EAP
"It follows, that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.",EAP
"An appeal to one's own heart is, after all, the best reply to the sophistry just noticed.",EAP
"No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question.",EAP
It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive.,EAP
"There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution.",EAP
"The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered.",EAP
That single thought is enough.,EAP
"The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.",EAP
We have a task before us which must be speedily performed.,EAP
We know that it will be ruinous to make delay.,EAP
"The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action.",EAP
"We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire.",EAP
"It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?",EAP
"There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no comprehension of the principle.",EAP
"To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay.",EAP
This craving gathers strength as the moments fly.,EAP
The last hour for action is at hand.,EAP
"We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us, -- of the definite with the indefinite -- of the substance with the shadow.",EAP
"But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the shadow which prevails, -- we struggle in vain.",EAP
"The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare.",EAP
"At the same time, it is the chanticleer -- note to the ghost that has so long overawed us.",EAP
It flies -- it disappears -- we are free.,EAP
The old energy returns.,EAP
We will labor now.,EAP
"Alas, it is too late!",EAP
We stand upon the brink of a precipice.,EAP
We peer into the abyss -- we grow sick and dizzy.,EAP
Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.,EAP
By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling.,EAP
"By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights.",EAP
"But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.",EAP
It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height.,EAP
And this fall -- this rushing annihilation -- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination -- for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it.,EAP
"And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it.",EAP
"There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge.",EAP
"To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot.",EAP
"If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.",EAP
"Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse.",EAP
We perpetrate them because we feel that we should not.,EAP
"Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.",EAP
"I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.",EAP
"Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad.",EAP
"As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse.",EAP
It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation.,EAP
"For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder.",EAP
"I rejected a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection.",EAP
"At length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned.",EAP
The idea struck my fancy at once.,EAP
I knew my victim's habit of reading in bed.,EAP
"I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated.",EAP
But I need not vex you with impertinent details.,EAP
"I need not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there found.",EAP
"The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the Coroner's verdict was -- ""Death by the visitation of God.""",EAP
"Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years.",EAP
The idea of detection never once entered my brain.,EAP
Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed.,EAP
"I had left no shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime.",EAP
It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security.,EAP
For a very long period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment.,EAP
It afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin.,EAP
"But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought.",EAP
It harassed because it haunted.,EAP
I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant.,EAP
"It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.",EAP
"Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera air meritorious.",EAP
"In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, ""I am safe.""",EAP
"One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables.",EAP
"In a fit of petulance, I remodelled them thus; ""I am safe -- I am safe -- yes -- if I be not fool enough to make open confession!""",EAP
"No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to my heart.",EAP
"I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks.",EAP
"And now my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of him whom I had murdered -- and beckoned me on to death.",EAP
"At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul.",EAP
I walked vigorously -- faster -- still faster -- at length I ran.,EAP
I felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud.,EAP
"Every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas!",EAP
"I well, too well understood that to think, in my situation, was to be lost.",EAP
I still quickened my pace.,EAP
I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.,EAP
"At length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me.",EAP
I felt then the consummation of my fate.,EAP
"Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears -- a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder.",EAP
I turned -- I gasped for breath.,EAP
"For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad palm upon the back.",EAP
The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.,EAP
"They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.",EAP
"Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.",EAP
But why shall I say more?,EAP
"To-day I wear these chains, and am here!",EAP
To-morrow I shall be fetterless!,EAP
"MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand.",EAP
"He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want.",EAP
"To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan's Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.",EAP
This Island is a very singular one.,EAP
"It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three miles long.",EAP
Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile.,EAP
"It is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh-hen.",EAP
"The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish.",EAP
No trees of any magnitude are to be seen.,EAP
"Near the western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England.",EAP
"The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with its fragrance.",EAP
"In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance.",EAP
This soon ripened into friendship --for there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem.,EAP
"I found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy.",EAP
"He had with him many books, but rarely employed them.",EAP
"His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological specimens;-his collection of the latter might have been envied by a Swammerdamm.",EAP
"In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young ""Massa Will.""",EAP
"It is not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.",EAP
"The winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary.",EAP
"About the middle of October, 18--, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness.",EAP
"Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks --my residence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine my miles from the Island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the present day.",EAP
"Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in.",EAP
A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth.,EAP
"It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one.",EAP
"I threw off an overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.",EAP
"Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome.",EAP
"Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens for supper.",EAP
Legrand was in one of his fits --how else shall I term them?,EAP
"He had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with Jupiter's assistance, a scarabaeus which he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.",EAP
"""And why not to-night?""",EAP
"I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing the whole tribe of scarabaei at the devil.",EAP
"""Ah, if I had only known you were here!""",EAP
"said Legrand, ""but it's so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others?",EAP
"As I was coming home I met Lieutenant G--, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until morning.",EAP
"Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise.",EAP
"It is the loveliest thing in creation!""",EAP
"It is of a brilliant gold color --about the size of a large hickory-nut --with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other.",EAP
"The antennae are --"" ""Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,"" here interrupted Jupiter; ""de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him, inside and all, sep him wing --neber feel half so hebby a bug in my life.""",EAP
"""Well, suppose it is, Jup,"" replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, ""is that any reason for your letting the birds burn?",EAP
"The color"" --here he turned to me --""is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea.",EAP
You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit --but of this you cannot judge till tomorrow.,EAP
"In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.""",EAP
"Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper.",EAP
"He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.",EAP
"""Never mind,"" said he at length, ""this will answer""; and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen.",EAP
"While he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly.",EAP
"When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising.",EAP
"As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door.",EAP
"Jupiter opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous visits.",EAP
"When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.",EAP
"I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, ""this is a strange scarabaeus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it before --unless it was a skull, or a death's-head --which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation.""",EAP
"echoed Legrand --""Oh --yes --well, it has something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt.",EAP
"The two upper black spots look like eyes, eh?",EAP
"and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth --and then the shape of the whole is oval.""",EAP
"""Perhaps so,"" said I; ""but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist.",EAP
"I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance.""",EAP
"""Well, I don't know,"" said he, a little nettled, ""I draw tolerably --should do it at least --have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.""",EAP
"""But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,"" said I, ""this is a very passable skull --indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology --and your scarabaeus must be the queerest scarabaeus in the world if it resembles it.",EAP
"Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint.",EAP
"I presume you will call the bug scarabaeus caput hominis, or something of that kind --there are many titles in the Natural Histories.",EAP
"But where are the antennae you spoke of?""",EAP
"said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject; ""I am sure you must see the antennae.",EAP
"I made them as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is sufficient.""",EAP
"""Well, well,"" I said, ""perhaps you have --still I don't see them;"" and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me --and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennae visible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death's-head.",EAP
"He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention.",EAP
In an instant his face grew violently red --in another as excessively pale.,EAP
For some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat.,EAP
"At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room.",EAP
Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions.,EAP
"He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment.",EAP
"Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked.",EAP
He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared.,EAP
Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted.,EAP
"As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him.",EAP
"It had been my to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave.",EAP
"He did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality.",EAP
"It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man, Jupiter.",EAP
"I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.",EAP
"""Well, Jup,"" said I, ""what is the matter now?",EAP
"--how is your master?""",EAP
"""Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.""",EAP
I am truly sorry to hear it.,EAP
"What does he complain of?""",EAP
"--him neber plain of notin --but him berry sick for all dat.""",EAP
--why didn't you say so at once?,EAP
"Is he confined to bed?""",EAP
"""No, dat he ain't!",EAP

"""Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking about.",EAP

"""Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate --de queerest figgurs I ebber did see.",EAP
"Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you.",EAP

"I had a big stick ready cut for to gib him d--d good beating when he did come --but Ise sich a fool dat I hadn't de heart arter all --he look so berry poorly.""",EAP
"--upon the whole I think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellow --don't flog him, Jupiter --he can't very well stand it --but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct?",EAP
"Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?""",EAP
"""No, massa, dey ain't bin noffin onpleasant since den --'t was fore den I'm feared --'t was de berry day you was dare.""",EAP
"what do you mean?""",EAP
"""Why, massa, I mean de bug --dare now.""",EAP

"""And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?""",EAP
"""Claws enoff, massa, and mouff too.",EAP

"Massa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell you --den was de time he must ha got de bite.",EAP
"I didn't like de look ob de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I wouldn't take hold ob him wid my finger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found.",EAP
"I rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it in he mouff --dat was de way.""",EAP
"""And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the beetle, and that the bite made him sick?""",EAP
"""I don't tink noffin about it --I nose it.",EAP

"Ise heerd bout dem goole-bugs fore dis.""",EAP
"""But how do you know he dreams about gold?""",EAP
"why cause he talk about it in he sleep --dat's how I nose.""",EAP
"""Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?""",EAP
"""What de matter, massa?""",EAP
"""Did you bring any message from Mr.",EAP
"""No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;"" and here Jupiter handed me a note which ran thus: My DEAR -- Why have I not seen you for so long a time?",EAP
"I hope you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little brusquerie of mine; but no, that is improbable.",EAP
Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety.,EAP
"I have something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should tell it at all.",EAP
"I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions.",EAP
Would you believe it?,EAP
"--he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, solus, among the hills on the main land.",EAP
I verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.,EAP
I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.,EAP
"If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter.",EAP
"I wish to see you tonight, upon business of importance.",EAP
I assure you that it is of the highest importance.,EAP
"Ever yours, WILLIAM LEGRAND.",EAP
There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness.,EAP
Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.,EAP
What could he be dreaming of?,EAP
What new crotchet possessed his excitable brain?,EAP
"What ""business of the highest importance"" could he possibly have to transact?",EAP
Jupiter's account of him boded no good.,EAP
"I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend.",EAP
"Without a moment's hesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro.",EAP
"; Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.",EAP
"""What is the meaning of all this, Jup?""",EAP
"""Him syfe, massa, and spade.""",EAP
"""Very true; but what are they doing here?""",EAP
"""Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and de debbil's own lot of money I had to gib for em.""",EAP
"But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your 'Massa Will' going to do with scythes and spades?""",EAP
"""Dat's more dan I know, and debbil take me if I don't blieve 'tis more dan he know, too.",EAP
"But it's all cum ob de bug.""",EAP
"Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by ""de bug,"" I now stepped into the boat and made sail.",EAP
"With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut.",EAP
It was about three in the afternoon when we arrived.,EAP
Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation.,EAP
He grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained.,EAP
"His countenance was pale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre.",EAP
"After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the scarabaeus from Lieutenant G--.",EAP
"""Oh, yes,"" he replied, coloring violently, ""I got it from him the next morning.",EAP
Nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabaeus.,EAP
"Do you know that Jupiter is quite right about it?""",EAP
"I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.",EAP
"""In supposing it to be a bug of real gold.""",EAP
"He said this with an air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.",EAP
"""This bug is to make my fortune,"" he continued, with a triumphant smile, ""to reinstate me in my family possessions.",EAP
"Is it any wonder, then, that I prize it?",EAP
"Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index.",EAP
"Jupiter, bring me that scarabaeus!""",EAP
"I'd rudder not go fer trubble dat bug --you mus git him for your own self.""",EAP
"Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed.",EAP
"It was a beautiful scarabaeus, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists --of course a great prize in a scientific point of view.",EAP
"There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other.",EAP
"The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold.",EAP
"The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand's agreement with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell.",EAP
"""I sent for you,"" said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed my examination of the beetle, ""I sent for you, that I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug""-- ""My dear Legrand,"" I cried, interrupting him, ""you are certainly unwell, and had better use some little precautions.",EAP
"You shall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over this.",EAP
"You are feverish and""-- ""Feel my pulse,"" said he.",EAP
"I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of fever.",EAP
"""But you may be ill and yet have no fever.",EAP
Allow me this once to prescribe for you.,EAP
"In the first place, go to bed.",EAP
"In the next""-- ""You are mistaken,"" he interposed, ""I am as well as I can expect to be under the excitement which I suffer.",EAP
"If you really wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.""",EAP
"""And how is this to be done?""",EAP
"Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition, we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide.",EAP
You are the only one we can trust.,EAP
"Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed.""",EAP
"""I am anxious to oblige you in any way,"" I replied; ""but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills?""",EAP
"""Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.",EAP
"""I am sorry --very sorry --for we shall have to try it by ourselves.""",EAP
"""Try it by yourselves!",EAP
The man is surely mad!,EAP
"--how long do you propose to be absent?""",EAP
"We shall start immediately, and be back, at all events, by sunrise.""",EAP
"""And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours is over, and the bug business (good God!)",EAP
"settled to your satisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of your physician?""",EAP
"""Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.""",EAP
With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend.,EAP
"We started about four o'clock --Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself.",EAP
"Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades --the whole of which he insisted upon carrying --more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance.",EAP
"His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and ""dat d--d bug"" were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey.",EAP
"For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the scarabaeus, which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a conjuror, as he went.",EAP
"When I observed this last, plain evidence of my friend's aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears.",EAP
"I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success.",EAP
"In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition.",EAP
"Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than ""we shall see!""",EAP
"We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff, and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland, proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen.",EAP
"Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.",EAP
"In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen.",EAP
"It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined.",EAP
"Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene.",EAP
"The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance.",EAP
"When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could climb it.",EAP
"The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply.",EAP
"At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention.",EAP
"When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said, ""Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.""",EAP
"""Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about.""",EAP
"""How far mus go up, massa?""",EAP
"""Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to go --and here --stop!",EAP
"take this beetle with you.""",EAP
"""De bug, Massa Will!",EAP
"cried the negro, drawing back in dismay --""what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?",EAP
"--d--n if I do!""",EAP
"""If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string --but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.""",EAP
"""What de matter now, massa?""",EAP
"said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; ""always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger.",EAP
Was only funnin' anyhow.,EAP
Me feered de bug!,EAP
"what I keer for de bug?""",EAP
"Here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree.",EAP
"In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipiferum, the most magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem.",EAP
"Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality.",EAP
"Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished.",EAP
"The risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground.",EAP
"""Which way mus go now, Massa Will?""",EAP
"Keep up the largest branch --the one on this side,"" said Legrand.",EAP
"The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it.",EAP
Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.,EAP
"""How much fudder is got for go?""",EAP
"""How high up are you?""",EAP
"""Ebber so fur,"" replied the negro; ""can see de sky fru de top ob de tree.""",EAP
"""Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say.",EAP
Look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side.,EAP
"How many limbs have you passed?""",EAP
"""One, two, tree, four, fibe --I done pass fibe big limb, massa, 'pon dis side.""",EAP
"""Then go one limb higher.""",EAP
"In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.",EAP
"""Now, Jup,"" cried Legrand, evidently much excited, ""I want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can.",EAP
"If you see anything strange, let me know.""",EAP
"By this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor friend's insanity, was put finally at rest.",EAP
"I had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious about getting him home.",EAP
"While I was pondering upon what was best to be done, Jupiter's voice was again heard.",EAP
"""Mos' feerd for to ventur 'pon dis limb berry far --'tis dead limb putty much all de way.""",EAP
"""Did you say it was a dead limb, Jupiter?""",EAP
cried Legrand in a quavering voice.,EAP
"""Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail --done up for sartain --done departed dis here life.""",EAP
"""What in the name of heaven shall I do?""",EAP
"asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest distress.",EAP
"said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, ""why come home and go to bed.",EAP
--that's a fine fellow.,EAP
"It's getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.""",EAP
"""Jupiter,"" cried he, without heeding me in the least, ""do you hear me?""",EAP
"""Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.""",EAP
"""Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it very rotten.""",EAP
"""Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,"" replied the negro in a few moments, ""but not so berry rotten as mought be.",EAP
"Mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself, dat's true.""",EAP
"--what do you mean?""",EAP
"""Why I mean de bug.",EAP
'Tis berry hebby bug.,EAP
"Spose I drop him down fuss, and den de limb won't break wid just de weight ob one nigger.""",EAP
"cried Legrand, apparently much relieved, ""what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that?",EAP
As sure as you let that beetle fall!,EAP
--I'll break your neck.,EAP
"do you hear me?""",EAP
"""Yes, massa, needn't hollo at poor nigger dat style.""",EAP
"--if you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe, and not let go the beetle, I'll make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.""",EAP
"""I'm gwine, Massa Will --deed I is,"" replied the negro very promptly --""mos out to the eend now.""",EAP
"""Out to the end!""",EAP
"here fairly screamed Legrand, ""do you say you are out to the end of that limb?""",EAP
"""Soon be to de eend, massa, --o-o-o-o-oh!",EAP
"what is dis here pon de tree?""",EAP
"cried Legrand, highly delighted, ""what is it?""",EAP
"""Why taint noffin but a skull --somebody bin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.""",EAP
"""A skull, you say!",EAP
--how is it fastened to the limb?,EAP
"--what holds it on?""",EAP
"""Sure nuff, massa; mus look.",EAP
"Why dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon my word --dare's a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.""",EAP
"""Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you --do you hear?""",EAP
"--find the left eye of the skull.""",EAP
"why dar ain't no eye lef' at all.""",EAP
"do you know your right hand from your left?""",EAP
"""Yes, I nose dat --nose all bout dat --'tis my left hand what I chops de wood wid.""",EAP
you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand.,EAP
"Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of the skull, or the place where the left eye has been.",EAP
"Have you found it?""",EAP
Here was a long pause.,EAP
"At length the negro asked, ""Is de lef' eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef' hand of de skull, too?",EAP
--cause de skull ain't got not a bit ob a hand at all --nebber mind!,EAP
I got de lef' eye now --here de lef' eye!,EAP
"what mus do wid it?""",EAP
"""Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach --but be careful and not let go your hold of the string.""",EAP
"""All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole --look out for him dar below?""",EAP
"During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter's person could be seen; but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood.",EAP
"The scarabaeus hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet.",EAP
"Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree.",EAP
"Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape-measure.",EAP
"Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty feet --Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe.",EAP
"At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described.",EAP
"Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to set about one to digging as quickly as possible.",EAP
"To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity by a refusal.",EAP
"Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro's disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master.",EAP
"I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabaeus, or, perhaps, by Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to be ""a bug of real gold.""",EAP
"A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions --especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas --and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech about the beetle's being ""the index of his fortune.""",EAP
"Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of necessity --to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained.",EAP
"The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our whereabouts.",EAP
We dug very steadily for two hours.,EAP
"Little was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest in our proceedings.",EAP
"He, at length, became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity; --or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand; --for myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home.",EAP
"The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth up with one of his suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.",EAP
"When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest.",EAP
"A general pause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end.",EAP
"Legrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced.",EAP
"We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet.",EAP
"The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor.",EAP
In the mean time I made no remark.,EAP
"Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools.",EAP
"This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home.",EAP
"We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar.",EAP
"The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.",EAP
"""You scoundrel,"" said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teeth --""you infernal black villain!",EAP
"--speak, I tell you!",EAP
"--answer me this instant, without prevarication!",EAP
"which --which is your left eye?""",EAP
"""Oh, my golly, Massa Will!",EAP
"ain't dis here my lef' eye for sartain?""",EAP
"roared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master's attempt at a gouge.",EAP
"vociferated Legrand, letting the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.",EAP
"we must go back,"" said the latter, ""the game's not up yet;"" and he again led the way to the tulip-tree.",EAP
"""Jupiter,"" said he, when we reached its foot, come here!",EAP
"was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outward, or with the face to the limb?""",EAP
"""De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any trouble.""",EAP
"""Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you let the beetle fall?""",EAP
--here Legrand touched each of Jupiter's eyes.,EAP
"""'Twas dis eye, massa --de lef' eye --jis as you tell me,"" and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated.",EAP
"""That will do --we must try it again.""",EAP
"Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position.",EAP
"Taking, now, the tape-measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging.",EAP
"Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades.",EAP
"I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed.",EAP
"I had become most unaccountably interested --nay, even excited.",EAP
"Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of Legrand --some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed me.",EAP
"I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion.",EAP
"At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog.",EAP
"His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone.",EAP
"Upon Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws.",EAP
"In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen.",EAP
"One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.",EAP
"At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment.",EAP
"He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.",EAP
"We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement.",EAP
"During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation, and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process --perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury.",EAP
"This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep.",EAP
"It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of trellis-work over the whole.",EAP
"On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron --six in all --by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons.",EAP
Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed.,EAP
We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight.,EAP
"Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts.",EAP
These we drew back --trembling and panting with anxiety.,EAP
"In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us.",EAP
"As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, a glow and a glare that absolutely dazzled our eyes.",EAP
I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.,EAP
"Amazement was, of course, predominant.",EAP
"Legrand appeared exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words.",EAP
"Jupiter's countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in the nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume.",EAP
He seemed stupefied --thunder-stricken.,EAP
"Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath.",EAP
"At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy.",EAP
"""And dis all cum ob de goole-bug!",EAP
"de poor little goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style!",EAP
"Ain't you shamed ob yourself, nigger?",EAP
"It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure.",EAP
"It was growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed before daylight.",EAP
It was difficult to say what should be done; and much time was spent in deliberation --so confused were the ideas of all.,EAP
"We, finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole.",EAP
"The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return.",EAP
"We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one o'clock in the morning.",EAP
"Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more just then.",EAP
"We rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises.",EAP
"A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.",EAP
We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose.,EAP
"After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our treasure.",EAP
"The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents.",EAP
There had been nothing like order or arrangement.,EAP
Every thing had been heaped in promiscuously.,EAP
"Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed.",EAP
"In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars --estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period.",EAP
There was not a particle of silver.,EAP
"All was gold of antique date and of great variety --French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before.",EAP
"There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions.",EAP
There was no American money.,EAP
The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating.,EAP
"There were diamonds --some of them exceedingly large and fine --a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy; --three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal.",EAP
These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest.,EAP
"The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification.",EAP
"Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments; --nearly two hundred massive finger and ear rings; --rich chains --thirty of these, if I remember; --eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; --five gold censers of great value; --a prodigious golden punch-bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect.",EAP
"The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one.",EAP
"Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion --but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth.",EAP
"We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and, upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure.",EAP
"When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it.",EAP
"""You remember,"" said he, ""the night when I handed you the rough sketch I had made of the scarabaeus.",EAP
"You recollect also, that I became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death's-head.",EAP
"When you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact.",EAP
"Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me --for I am considered a good artist --and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.""",EAP
"""The scrap of paper, you mean,"" said I.",EAP
"""No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment.",EAP
"It was quite dirty, you remember.",EAP
"Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle.",EAP
For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy.,EAP
I knew that my design was very different in detail from this --although there was a certain similarity in general outline.,EAP
"Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely.",EAP
"Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it.",EAP
"My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline --at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the scarabaeus and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing.",EAP
I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied me for a time.,EAP
This is the usual effect of such coincidences.,EAP
"The mind struggles to establish a connection --a sequence of cause and effect --and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis.",EAP
"But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence.",EAP
"I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing on the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabaeus.",EAP
"I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot.",EAP
"Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it.",EAP
"Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there it seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration.",EAP
"I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.",EAP
"""When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair.",EAP
In the first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession.,EAP
"The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water mark.",EAP
"Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop.",EAP
"Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it.",EAP
"It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper.",EAP
"It was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking up.",EAP
"Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship's long boat.",EAP
The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.,EAP
"""Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to me.",EAP
"Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met Lieutenant G--.",EAP
"I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take it to the fort.",EAP
"On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection.",EAP
"Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once --you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History.",EAP
"At the same time without being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.",EAP
"""You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept.",EAP
"I looked in the drawer, and found none there.",EAP
"I searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter --and then my hand fell upon the parchment.",EAP
I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.,EAP
"""No doubt you will think me fanciful --but I had already established a kind of connexion.",EAP
I had put together two links of a great chain.,EAP
"There was a boat lying on a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment --not a paper --with a skull depicted on it.",EAP
"You will, of course, ask 'where is the connexion?'",EAP
"I reply that the skull, or death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate.",EAP
The flag of the death's-head is hoisted in all engagements.,EAP
"""I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper.",EAP
Parchment is durable --almost imperishable.,EAP
"Matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper.",EAP
This reflection suggested some meaning --some relevancy --in the death's-head.,EAP
"I did not fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment.",EAP
"Although one of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong.",EAP
"It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum --for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved.""",EAP
"""But,"" I interposed, ""you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle.",EAP
"How then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull --since this latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabaeus?""",EAP
"""Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving.",EAP
"My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result.",EAP
"I reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the scarabaeus, there was no skull apparent on the parchment.",EAP
"When I had completed the drawing, I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it.",EAP
"You, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present to do it.",EAP
Then it was not done by human agency.,EAP
And nevertheless it was done.,EAP
"""At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about the period in question.",EAP
The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy accident!,EAP
"), and a fire was blazing on the hearth.",EAP
I was heated with exercise and sat near the table.,EAP
"You, however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney.",EAP
"Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders.",EAP
"With your left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire.",EAP
"At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination.",EAP
"When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light, on the parchment, the skull which I saw designed on it.",EAP
"You are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write on either paper or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire.",EAP
"Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results.",EAP
"The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red.",EAP
"These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written on cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application of heat.",EAP
"""I now scrutinized the death's-head with care.",EAP
Its outer edges --the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum --were far more distinct than the others.,EAP
It was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal.,EAP
"I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat.",EAP
"At first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, on persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat.",EAP
"A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid.""",EAP
"said I, ""to be sure I have no right to laugh at you --a million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth --but you are not about to establish a third link in your chain --you will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and goat --pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.""",EAP
"""But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.""",EAP
"""Well, a kid then --pretty much the same thing.""",EAP
"""Pretty much, but not altogether,"" said Legrand.",EAP
"""You may have heard of one Captain Kidd.",EAP
I at once looked on the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature.,EAP
I say signature; because its position on the vellum suggested this idea.,EAP
"The death's-head at the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp, or seal.",EAP
"But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else --of the body to my imagined instrument --of the text for my context.""",EAP
"""I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature.""",EAP
"""Something of that kind.",EAP
"The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending.",EAP
I can scarcely say why.,EAP
"Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual belief; --but do you know that Jupiter's silly words, about the bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect on my fancy?",EAP
And then the series of accidents and coincidences --these were so very extraordinary.,EAP
"Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred on the sole day of all the year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the death's-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure?""",EAP
"""But proceed --I am all impatience.""",EAP
"""Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current --the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere on the Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.",EAP
These rumors must have had some foundation in fact.,EAP
"And that the rumors have existed so long and so continuously could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed.",EAP
"Had Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form.",EAP
"You will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about money-finders.",EAP
"Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped.",EAP
"It seemed to me that some accident --say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality --had deprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to is followers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided attempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so common.",EAP
"Have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast?""",EAP
"""But that Kidd's accumulations were immense, is well known.",EAP
"I took it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved a lost record of the place of deposit.""",EAP
"""But how did you proceed?""",EAP
"""I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared.",EAP
"I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal.",EAP
"In a few minutes, the pan having become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines.",EAP
"Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to remain another minute.",EAP
"On taking it off, the whole was just as you see it now.""",EAP
"Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted It my inspection.",EAP
"The following characters were rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death's-head and the goat: 53++!305))6*;4826)4+.)4+);806*;48!8`60))85;]8*:+*8!83(88)5*!",EAP

"; ""But,"" said I, returning him the slip, ""I am as much in the dark as ever.",EAP
"Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me on my solution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable to earn them.""",EAP
"""And yet,"" said Legrand, ""the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters.",EAP
"These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a cipher --that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs.",EAP
"I made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple species --such, however, as would appear, to the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.""",EAP
"""And you really solved it?""",EAP
"""Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater.",EAP
"Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to take interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve.",EAP
"In fact, having once established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import.",EAP
"""In the present case --indeed in all cases of secret writing --the first question regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned, depend on, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom.",EAP
"In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution, until the true one be attained.",EAP
"But, with the cipher now before us, all difficulty is removed by the signature.",EAP
The pun on the word 'Kidd' is appreciable in no other language than the English.,EAP
"But for this consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main.",EAP
"As it was, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.",EAP
"""You observe there are no divisions between the words.",EAP
"Had there been divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy.",EAP
"In such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured.",EAP
"But, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters, as well as the least frequent.",EAP
"Counting all, I constructed a table, thus: Of the character 8 there are 33. ; "" 26.",EAP
"+ ) "" 16.",EAP
"6 "" 11. !",EAP
"9 2 "" 5. : 3 "" 4. ? """,EAP
"""Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is e. Afterwards, the succession runs thus: a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z. E however predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.",EAP
"""Here, then, we have, in the very beginning, the groundwork for something more than a mere guess.",EAP
"The general use which may be made of the table is obvious --but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very partially require its aid.",EAP
"As our predominant character is 8, we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet.",EAP
"To verify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples --for e is doubled with great frequency in English --in such words, for example, as 'meet,' 'fleet,' 'speed, 'seen,' 'been,' 'agree,' &c. In the present instance we see it doubled less than five times, although the cryptograph is brief.",EAP
"""Let us assume 8, then, as e. Now, of all words in the language, 'the' is the most usual; let us see, therefore, whether they are not repetitions of any three characters in the same order of collocation, the last of them being 8.",EAP
"If we discover repetitions of such letters, so arranged, they will most probably represent the word 'the.'",EAP
"On inspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the characters being ;48.",EAP
"We may, therefore, assume that the semicolon represents t, that 4 represents h, and that 8 represents e --the last being now well confirmed.",EAP
Thus a great step has been taken.,EAP
"""But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish a vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and terminations of other words.",EAP
"Let us refer, for example, to the last instance but one, in which the combination ;48 occurs --not far from the end of the cipher.",EAP
"We know that the semicolon immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this 'the,' we are cognizant of no less than five.",EAP
"Let us set these characters down, thus, by the letters we know them to represent, leaving a space for the unknown-- t eeth ""Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the 'th,' as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t; since, by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part.",EAP
"We are thus narrowed into t ee and, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive at the word 'tree,' as the sole possible reading.",EAP
"We thus gain another letter, r, represented by (, with the words 'the tree' in juxtaposition.",EAP
"""Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see the combination ;48, and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes.",EAP
"We have thus this arrangement: the tree ;4(+?34 the, or substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus: the tree thr+?3h the.",EAP
"""Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces, or substitute dots, we read thus: the tree thr...h the, when the word 'through' makes itself evident at once.",EAP
"But this discovery gives us three new letters, o, u and g, represented by + ?",EAP
"""Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement, 83(88, or egree, which, plainly, is the conclusion of the word 'degree,' and gives us another letter, d, represented by !.",EAP
"""Four letters beyond the word 'degree,' we perceive the combination ;46(;88*.",EAP
"""Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by dots, as before, we read thus: th.rtee an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word 'thirteen,' and again furnishing us with two new characters, i and n, represented by 6 and *.",EAP
"""Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the combination, 53++!.",EAP
"""Translating, as before, we obtain .good, which assures us that the first letter is A, and that the first two words are 'A good.'",EAP
"""To avoid confusion, it is now time that we arrange our key, as far as discovered, in a tabular form.",EAP

"d 8 "" e 3 "" g 4 "" h 6 "" i * "" n + "" o ( "" r ; "" t ""We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important letters represented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution.",EAP
"I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the rationale of their development.",EAP
But be assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph.,EAP
"It now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment, as unriddled.",EAP
"Here it is: 'A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death's-head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.'""",EAP
"""But,"" said I, ""the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever.",EAP
"How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about 'devil's seats,' 'death's-heads,' and 'bishop's hostel'?""",EAP
"""I confess,"" replied Legrand, ""that the matter still wears a serious aspect, when regarded with a casual glance.",EAP
"My first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist.""",EAP
"""You mean, to punctuate it?""",EAP
"""Something of that kind.""",EAP
"""But how was it possible to effect this?""",EAP
"""I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution.",EAP

"If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding.",EAP
"Acting on this hint, I made the division thus: 'A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's --twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes --northeast and by north --main branch seventh limb east side --shoot from the left eye of the death's-head --a bee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.'""",EAP
"""Even this division,"" said I, ""leaves me still in the dark.""",EAP
"""It left me also in the dark,"" replied Legrand, ""for a few days; during which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan's Island, for any building which went by the name of the 'Bishop's Hotel'; for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word 'hostel.'",EAP
"Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that this 'Bishop's Hostel' might have some reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the Island.",EAP
"I accordingly went over to the plantation, and reinstituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place.",EAP
"At length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as Bessop's Castle, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that it was not a castle, nor a tavern, but a high rock.",EAP
"""I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur, she consented to accompany me to the spot.",EAP
"We found it without much difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place.",EAP
The 'castle' consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks --one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance.,EAP
"I clambered to its apex, and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done.",EAP
"""While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit on which I stood.",EAP
"This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors.",EAP
"I made no doubt that here was the 'devil's-seat' alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.",EAP
"""The 'good glass,' I knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope; for the word 'glass' is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen.",EAP
"Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite point of view, admitting no variation, from which to use it.",EAP
"Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,' and northeast and by north,' were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass.",EAP
"Greatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the rock.",EAP
"""I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to retain a seat on it unless in one particular position.",EAP
This fact confirmed my preconceived idea.,EAP
I proceeded to use the glass.,EAP
"Of course, the 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by north.'",EAP
"This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of twenty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance.",EAP
"In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was.",EAP
"Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull.",EAP
"""On this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the phrase 'main branch, seventh limb, east side,' could refer only to the position of the skull on the tree, while shoot from the left eye of the death's-head' admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure.",EAP
"I perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot,' (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite point --and beneath this point I thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed.""",EAP
"""All this,"" I said, ""is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still simple and explicit.",EAP
"When you left the Bishop's Hotel, what then?""",EAP
"""Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned homewards.",EAP
"The instant that I left 'the devil's seat,' however, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would.",EAP
"What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge on the face of the rock.",EAP
"""In this expedition to the 'Bishop's Hotel' I had been attended by Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me alone.",EAP
"But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give him the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree.",EAP
After much toil I found it.,EAP
When I came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging.,EAP
"With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself.""",EAP
"""I suppose,"" said I, ""you missed the spot, in the first attempt at digging through Jupiter's stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of the left of the skull.""",EAP
"This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the 'shot' --that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest the tree; and had the treasure been beneath the 'shot,' the error would have been of little moment; but the 'shot,' together with the nearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however trivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the scent.",EAP
"But for my deep-seated convictions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.""",EAP
"""I presume the fancy of the skull, of letting fall a bullet through the skull's eye --was suggested to Kidd by the piratical flag.",EAP
"No doubt he felt a kind of poetical consistency in recovering his money through this ominous insignium.""",EAP
"""Perhaps so; still I cannot help thinking that common-sense had quite as much to do with the matter as poetical consistency.",EAP
"To be visible from the devil's-seat, it was necessary that the object, if small, should be white; and there is nothing like your human skull for retaining and even increasing its whiteness under exposure to all vicissitudes of weather.""",EAP
"""But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle --how excessively odd!",EAP
I was sure you were mad.,EAP
"And why did you insist on letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?""",EAP
"""Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification.",EAP
"For this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall from the tree.",EAP
"An observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea.""",EAP
"""Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me.",EAP
"What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?""",EAP
"""That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself.",EAP
"There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them --and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply.",EAP
"It is clear that Kidd --if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt not --it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor.",EAP
"But, the worst of this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret.",EAP
"Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen --who shall tell?""",EAP
"THE ""Red Death"" had long devastated the country.",EAP
"No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous.",EAP
Blood was its Avator and its seal � the redness and the horror of blood.,EAP
"There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.",EAP
"The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men.",EAP
"And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.",EAP
But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious.,EAP
"When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys.",EAP
"This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste.",EAP
A strong and lofty wall girdled it in.,EAP
This wall had gates of iron.,EAP
"The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.",EAP
They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within.,EAP
The abbey was amply provisioned.,EAP
With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion.,EAP
The external world could take care of itself.,EAP
"In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think.",EAP
The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure.,EAP
"There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine.",EAP
All these and security were within.,EAP
"Without was the ""Red Death.""",EAP
"It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.",EAP
"It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade.",EAP
But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held.,EAP
There were seven � an imperial suite.,EAP
"In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.",EAP
Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the bizarre.,EAP
The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time.,EAP
"There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect.",EAP
"To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite.",EAP
These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened.,EAP
"That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue � and vividly blue were its windows.",EAP
"The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple.",EAP
"The third was green throughout, and so were the casements.",EAP
The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange � the fifth with white � the sixth with violet.,EAP
"The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue.",EAP
"But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.",EAP
The panes here were scarlet � a deep blood color.,EAP
"Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof.",EAP
There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers.,EAP
"But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room.",EAP
And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances.,EAP
"But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.",EAP
"It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony.",EAP
"Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation.",EAP
"But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.",EAP
"But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.",EAP
The tastes of the duke were peculiar.,EAP
He had a fine eye for colors and effects.,EAP
He disregarded the decora of mere fashion.,EAP
"His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre.",EAP
There are some who would have thought him mad.,EAP
His followers felt that he was not.,EAP
It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.,EAP
"He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders.",EAP
Be sure they were grotesque.,EAP
"There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm � much of what has been since seen in ""Hernani.""",EAP
There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments.,EAP
There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions.,EAP
"There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.",EAP
"To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.",EAP
"And these � the dreams � writhed in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.",EAP
"And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.",EAP
"And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock.",EAP
The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.,EAP
"But the echoes of the chime die away � they have endured but an instant � and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart.",EAP
"And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.",EAP
"But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.",EAP
"But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.",EAP
"And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.",EAP
"And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.",EAP
"But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.",EAP
"And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before.",EAP
"And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise � then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.",EAP
"In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.",EAP
"In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum.",EAP
There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.,EAP
"Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made.",EAP
"The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.",EAP
"The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave.",EAP
The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.,EAP
"And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around.",EAP
But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death.,EAP
"His vesture was dabbled in blood � and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.",EAP
"When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.",EAP
"he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him � ""who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery?",EAP
"Seize him and unmask him � that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the battlements!""",EAP
It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words.,EAP
"They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly � for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.",EAP
"It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side.",EAP
"At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who, at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker.",EAP
"But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple � through the purple to the green � through the green to the orange � through this again to the white � and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him.",EAP
"It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.",EAP
"He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.",EAP
"There was a sharp cry � and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero.",EAP
"Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.",EAP
And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.,EAP
He had come like a thief in the night.,EAP
"And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.",EAP
And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay.,EAP
And the flames of the tripods expired.,EAP
And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.,EAP
THE symposium of the preceding evening had been a little too much for my nerves.,EAP
"I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.",EAP
"Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.",EAP
A light supper of course.,EAP
I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit.,EAP
"More than a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable.",EAP
"Still, there can be no material objection to two.",EAP
"And really between two and three, there is merely a single unit of difference.",EAP
"I ventured, perhaps, upon four.",EAP
"My wife will have it five; -- but, clearly, she has confounded two very distinct affairs.",EAP
"The abstract number, five, I am willing to admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout, without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.",EAP
"Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a profound slumber forthwith.",EAP
But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled?,EAP
"I could not have completed my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once.",EAP
"In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner.",EAP
"It ran thus: Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive this.",EAP
Come and help us to rejoice.,EAP
"At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination of the Mummy -- you know the one I mean.",EAP
"I have permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable.",EAP
"A few friends only will be present -- you, of course.",EAP
"The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.",EAP
"By the time I had reached the ""Ponnonner,"" it struck me that I was as wide awake as a man need be.",EAP
"I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor's.",EAP
There I found a very eager company assembled.,EAP
They had been awaiting me with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and the moment I entered its examination was commenced.,EAP
"It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner's from a tomb near Eleithias, in the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.",EAP
"The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians.",EAP
"The chamber from which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such illustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.",EAP
"The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it; -- that is to say, the coffin had not been disturbed.",EAP
"For eight years it had thus stood, subject only externally to public inspection.",EAP
"We had now, therefore, the complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.",EAP
"Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep.",EAP
It was oblong -- not coffin-shaped.,EAP
"The material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore (platanus), but, upon cutting into it, we found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, papier mache, composed of papyrus.",EAP
"It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects -- interspersed among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed.",EAP
"By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the word Allamistakeo.",EAP
"We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second, coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one, but resembling it precisely in every other respect.",EAP
"The interval between the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the colors of the interior box.",EAP
"Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood.",EAP
Between the second and the third case there was no interval -- the one fitting accurately within the other.,EAP
"Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.",EAP
"We had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath, made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and painted.",EAP
"The paintings represented subjects connected with the various supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as portraits of the persons embalmed.",EAP
"Extending from head to foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.",EAP
"Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe.",EAP
Around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt.,EAP
"Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation, with no perceptible odor.",EAP
The color was reddish.,EAP
"The skin was hard, smooth, and glossy.",EAP
The teeth and hair were in good condition.,EAP
"The eyes (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too determined a stare.",EAP
The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.,EAP
"Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums became apparent.",EAP
"We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.",EAP
No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met.,EAP
"The brain it was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.",EAP
"As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two o'clock.",EAP
"Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.",EAP
"The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original, and we all caught it at once.",EAP
"About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor's study, and conveyed thither the Egyptian.",EAP
"It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with the wire.",EAP
"This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement.",EAP
"My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea remained visible.",EAP
"With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately obvious to all.",EAP
"I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because ""alarmed"" is, in my case, not exactly the word.",EAP
"It is possible, however, that, but for the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous.",EAP
"As for the rest of the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright fright which possessed them.",EAP
Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.,EAP
"Mr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible.",EAP
"Silk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his way, upon all fours, under the table.",EAP
"After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter of course, upon further experiment forthwith.",EAP
Our operations were now directed against the great toe of the right foot.,EAP
"We made an incision over the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis, and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle.",EAP
"Readjusting the battery, we now applied the fluid to the bisected nerves -- when, with a movement of exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner, which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a catapult, through a window into the street below.",EAP
"We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with vigor and with zeal.",EAP
"It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound incision into the tip of the subject's nose, while the Doctor himself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the wire.",EAP
Morally and physically -- figuratively and literally -- was the effect electric.,EAP
"In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner's face; in the fifth, turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital Egyptian, thus: ""I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at your behaviour.",EAP
Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected.,EAP
He is a poor little fat fool who knows no better.,EAP
I pity and forgive him.,EAP
"But you, Mr. Gliddon- and you, Silk -- who have travelled and resided in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born -- you, I say who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I think, as you write your mother tongue -- you, whom I have always been led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies -- I really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you.",EAP
What am I to think of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used?,EAP
"What am I to suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate?",EAP
"In what light (to come to the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?""",EAP
"It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon.",EAP
"One of these three things was, I say, to be expected.",EAP
Indeed each and all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued.,EAP
"And, upon my word, I am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other.",EAP
"But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and impossibility.",EAP
"Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy's exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.",EAP
"However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.",EAP
"For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside, out of the range of the Egyptian's fist.",EAP
"Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands into his breeches' pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively red in the face.",EAP
Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt.,EAP
"Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.",EAP
"The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and at length, with a sneer, said: ""Why don't you speak, Mr. Buckingham?",EAP
"Did you hear what I asked you, or not?",EAP
"Do take your thumb out of your mouth!""",EAP
"Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.",EAP
"Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant.",EAP
"Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his very excellent speech.",EAP
"I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company) -- through the medium, I say, of Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters.",EAP
"These gentlemen spoke the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger) the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.",EAP
"Mr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term ""politics,"" until he sketched upon the wall, with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees.",EAP
"Just in the same way Mr. Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea ""wig,"" until (at Doctor Ponnonner's suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and consented to take off his own.",EAP
"It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon's discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended.",EAP
Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.,EAP
"In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the company all round.",EAP
"When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.",EAP
"We sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.",EAP
"It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering -- no doubt from the cold.",EAP
"The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black dress coat, made in Jennings' best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat.",EAP
"Owing to the disparity of size between the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be dressed.",EAP
"Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.",EAP
The conversation soon grew animated.,EAP
"Much curiosity was, of course, expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo's still remaining alive.",EAP
"""I should have thought,"" observed Mr. Buckingham, ""that it is high time you were dead.""",EAP
"""Why,"" replied the Count, very much astonished, ""I am little more than seven hundred years old!",EAP
"My father lived a thousand, and was by no means in his dotage when he died.""",EAP
"Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly misjudged.",EAP
It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.,EAP
"""But my remark,"" resumed Mr. Buckingham, ""had no reference to your age at the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.""",EAP
"""In asphaltum,"" persisted Mr. B.",EAP
"""Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to answer, no doubt -- but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else than the Bichloride of Mercury.""",EAP
"""But what we are especially at a loss to understand,"" said Doctor Ponnonner, ""is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so delightfully well.""",EAP
"""Had I been, as you say, dead,"" replied the Count, ""it is more than probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the infancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common thing among us in the old days.",EAP
"But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy, and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should be; they accordingly embalmed me at once -- I presume you are aware of the chief principle of the embalming process?""",EAP
"""Why, I perceive -- a deplorable condition of ignorance!",EAP
"Well I cannot enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process.",EAP
"I use the word 'animal' in its widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being.",EAP
"I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.",EAP
"To be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that condition he remained.",EAP
"Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.""",EAP
"""The blood of the Scarabaeus!""",EAP
"The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the 'arms,' of a very distinguished and very rare patrician family.",EAP
"To be 'of the blood of the Scarabaeus,' is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is the insignium.",EAP
"""But what has this to do with you being alive?""",EAP
"""Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did not coincide with the custom.",EAP
"Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is inconvenient to live.""",EAP
"""I perceive that,"" said Mr. Buckingham, ""and I presume that all the entire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.""",EAP
"""I thought,"" said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, ""that the Scarabaeus was one of the Egyptian gods.""",EAP
"""One of the Egyptian what?""",EAP
"exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.",EAP
"""Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,"" said the Count, resuming his chair.",EAP
"""No nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged more than one god.",EAP
"The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be more directly approached.""",EAP
There was here a pause.,EAP
At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor Ponnonner.,EAP
"""It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,"" said he, ""that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?""",EAP
"""There can be no question of it,"" replied the Count; ""all the Scarabaei embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now.",EAP
"Even some of those purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and still remain in the tomb.""",EAP
"""Will you be kind enough to explain,"" I said, ""what you mean by 'purposely so embalmed'?""",EAP
"answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely through his eye-glass -- for it was the first time I had ventured to address him a direct question.",EAP
"""With great pleasure,"" he said.",EAP
"""The usual duration of man's life, in my time, was about eight hundred years.",EAP
"Few men died, unless by most extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.",EAP
"After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments.",EAP
"In the case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this kind was indispensable.",EAP
"An historian, for example, having attained the age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period -- say five or six hundred years.",EAP
"Resuming existence at the expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of hap-hazard note-book -- that is to say, into a kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.",EAP
"These guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book.",EAP
"When discovered, it was never worth the trouble of the search.",EAP
"After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived.",EAP
"Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification, pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.""",EAP
"""I beg your pardon,"" said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian -- ""I beg your pardon, sir, but may I presume to interrupt you for one moment?""",EAP
"""By all means, sir,"" replied the Count, drawing up.",EAP
"""I merely wished to ask you a question,"" said the Doctor.",EAP
"""You mentioned the historian's personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch.",EAP
"Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were usually found to be right?""",EAP
"""The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written histories themselves; -- that is to say, not one individual iota of either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically wrong.""",EAP
"""But since it is quite clear,"" resumed the Doctor, ""that at least five thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten centuries before.""",EAP
said the Count Allamistakeo.,EAP
"The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them.",EAP
"The latter at length said, hesitatingly: ""The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel.",EAP
During my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at all.,EAP
"I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin of the human race; and by this individual, the very word Adam (or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed.",EAP
"He employed it, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated) -- the spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.""",EAP
"Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air.",EAP
"Silk Buckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of Allamistakeo, spoke as follows: ""The long duration of human life in your time, together with the occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge.",EAP
"I presume, therefore, that we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.""",EAP
"""I confess again,"" replied the Count, with much suavity, ""that I am somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science do you allude?""",EAP
"Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.",EAP
"Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.",EAP
I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses.,EAP
"He smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.",EAP
"This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one Plutarch de facie lunae.",EAP
"I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow, and begged me for God's sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus.",EAP
"As for the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of the Egyptians.",EAP
"While I was thinking how I should answer this question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very extraordinary way.",EAP
"""Look at our architecture!""",EAP
"he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.",EAP
"""Look,"" he cried with enthusiasm, ""at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New York!",EAP
"or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the Capitol at Washington, D.",EAP
"-- and the good little medical man went on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he referred.",EAP
"He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.",EAP
"The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes.",EAP
"He recollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.",EAP
"The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height.",EAP
"The palace itself (as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been altogether about seven in circuit.",EAP
"Its walls were richly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics.",EAP
"He would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor's Capitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble.",EAP
That palace at Carnac was an insignificant little building after all.,EAP
"He (the Count), however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the Doctor.",EAP
"Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.",EAP
I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.,EAP
"""Nothing,"" he replied, ""in particular.""",EAP
"They were rather slight, rather ill-conceived, and clumsily put together.",EAP
"They could not be compared, of course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude.",EAP
I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.,EAP
"He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at Carnac.",EAP
"This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.",EAP
"I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.",EAP
This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to Metaphysics.,EAP
"We sent for a copy of a book called the ""Dial,"" and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.",EAP
"The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it never progressed.",EAP
"We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.",EAP
"He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.",EAP
"When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred something of a very similar sort.",EAP
"Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of mankind.",EAP
"They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive.",EAP
For a while they managed remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.,EAP
"The thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.",EAP
I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.,EAP
"As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.",EAP
"Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the Egyptian ignorance of steam.",EAP
"The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer.",EAP
"The silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows -- told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once -- and demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.",EAP
"We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue, and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the all- important particular of dress.",EAP
"The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some minutes.",EAP
"Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply.",EAP
"Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the manufacture of either Ponnonner's lozenges or Brandreth's pills.",EAP
"We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer -- but in vain.",EAP
It was not forthcoming.,EAP
The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head.,EAP
Never was triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.,EAP
"Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy's mortification.",EAP
"I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.",EAP
"Upon getting home I found it past four o'clock, and went immediately to bed.",EAP
It is now ten A.M.,EAP
"I have been up since seven, penning these memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind.",EAP
The former I shall behold no more.,EAP
My wife is a shrew.,EAP
"The truth is, I am heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general.",EAP
I am convinced that every thing is going wrong.,EAP
"Besides, I am anxious to know who will be President in 2045.",EAP
"As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner's and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years.",EAP
"THE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe.",EAP
To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned.,EAP
We established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments.,EAP
It lay in a remote turret of the building.,EAP
"Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique.",EAP
"Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque.",EAP
"In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary -- in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room -- since it was already night -- to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed -- and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself.",EAP
"I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.",EAP
"Long -- long I read -- and devoutly, devotedly I gazed.",EAP
Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came.,EAP
"The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.",EAP
But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated.,EAP
The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts.,EAP
I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before.,EAP
It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood.,EAP
"I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes.",EAP
Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception.,EAP
"But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them.",EAP
It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought -- to make sure that my vision had not deceived me -- to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze.,EAP
In a very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.,EAP
"That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.",EAP
"The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl.",EAP
"It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully.",EAP
"The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole.",EAP
"The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque.",EAP
As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself.,EAP
"But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me.",EAP
"Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person.",EAP
"I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea -- must have prevented even its momentary entertainment.",EAP
"Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait.",EAP
"At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed.",EAP
"I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me.",EAP
With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position.,EAP
"The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories.",EAP
"Turning to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words which follow: ""She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee.",EAP
"And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter.",EAP
"He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover.",EAP
It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray even his young bride.,EAP
"But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead.",EAP
"But he, the painter, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to day.",EAP
"And be was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him.",EAP
"Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak.",EAP
"And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well.",EAP
"But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife.",EAP
And he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him.,EAP
"And when many weeks bad passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp.",EAP
"And then the brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice, 'This is indeed Life itself!'",EAP
turned suddenly to regard his beloved: -- She was dead!,EAP
"MANY years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of ""love at first sight;"" but those who think, not less than those who feel deeply, have always advocated its existence.",EAP
"Modern discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy -- in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance.",EAP
The confession I am about to make will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position.,EAP
My story requires that I should be somewhat minute.,EAP
I am still a very young man -- not yet twenty-two years of age.,EAP
"My name, at present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one -- Simpson.",EAP
"I say ""at present;"" for it is only lately that I have been so called -- having legislatively adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq.",EAP
"The bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator, -- the family, not the Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte -- or, more properly, these are my first and middle appellations.",EAP
"I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride -- believing that I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the Chronicles.",EAP
"While on the subject of names, by the bye, I may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors.",EAP
"My father was a Monsieur Froissart, of Paris.",EAP
"His wife -- my mother, whom he married at fifteen -- was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart.",EAP
"Monsieur Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name -- a Mademoiselle Moissart.",EAP
"She, too, was quite a child when married; and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led to the altar.",EAP
These early marriages are usual in France.,EAP
"Here, however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in the direct line of descent.",EAP
"My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.",EAP
"As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient.",EAP
"On the contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome face.",EAP
In height I am five feet eleven.,EAP
My hair is black and curling.,EAP
My nose is sufficiently good.,EAP
"My eyes are large and gray; and although, in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance.",EAP
"The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have resorted to every remedy -- short of wearing glasses.",EAP
"Being youthful and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them.",EAP
"I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age.",EAP
"An eyeglass, on the other hand, has a savor of downright foppery and affectation.",EAP
I have hitherto managed as well as I could without either.,EAP
"But something too much of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little importance.",EAP
"I will content myself with saying, in addition, that my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic -- and that all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women.",EAP
"One night last winter I entered a box at the P- -- Theatre, in company with a friend, Mr. Talbot.",EAP
"It was an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded.",EAP
"We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.",EAP
"For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the city.",EAP
"Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation.",EAP
"If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense emotion with which I regarded this figure.",EAP
"It was that of a female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld.",EAP
"The face was so far turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it -- but the form was divine; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion -- and even the term ""divine"" seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.",EAP
"The magic of a lovely form in woman -- the necromancy of female gracefulness -- was always a power which I had found it impossible to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions.",EAP
"The figure, almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the majestic.",EAP
Its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious.,EAP
"The head of which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of Apuleius.",EAP
"The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.",EAP
Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion.,EAP
This extended but little below the elbow.,EAP
"Beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of extraordinary value.",EAP
"The admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels-telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer.",EAP
"I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning ""love at first sight.""",EAP
"My feelings were totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness.",EAP
"An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the admirable object before me.",EAP
"I saw -- I felt -- I knew that I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in love -- and this even before seeing the face of the person beloved.",EAP
"So intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary character, so anomalous is the nature of the only true love -- of the love at first sight -- and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it.",EAP
"While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face.",EAP
Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations -- and yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was.,EAP
"I said ""disappointed,"" but this is not altogether the word.",EAP
My sentiments were at once quieted and exalted.,EAP
They partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose.,EAP
"This state of feeling arose, perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this.",EAP
There was something else- some mystery which I could not develope -- some expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest.,EAP
"In fact, I was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance.",EAP
"Had the lady been alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two companions -- a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than herself.",EAP
"I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty.",EAP
"I would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had I been so fortunate as to have one with me -- but I had not -- and was thus in despair.",EAP
At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.,EAP
"""Talbot,"" I said, ""you have an opera-glass.",EAP
"Let me have it.""",EAP
"""An opera -- glass!",EAP
"-- what do you suppose I would be doing with an opera-glass?""",EAP
Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.,EAP
"""But, Talbot,"" I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, ""listen to me will you?",EAP
Do you see the stage -- box?,EAP
"-- no, the next.",EAP
"-- did you ever behold as lovely a woman?""",EAP
"""She is very beautiful, no doubt,"" he said.",EAP
"""I wonder who she can be?""",EAP
"""Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don't you know who she is?",EAP
'Not to know her argues yourself unknown.',EAP
"She is the celebrated Madame Lalande -- the beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the whole town.",EAP
"Immensely wealthy too -- a widow, and a great match -- has just arrived from Paris.""",EAP
"""Do you know her?""",EAP
"""Yes; I have the honor.""",EAP
"""Will you introduce me?""",EAP
"""Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?""",EAP
"""To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B--'s.",EAP
"""Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.""",EAP
"In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot's advice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage.",EAP
"In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face.",EAP
"It was exquisitely lovely -- this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point -- but still the unintelligible something disturbed me.",EAP
"I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with an interest tenfold.",EAP
"While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze.",EAP
"Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant.",EAP
"She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head.",EAP
"After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze.",EAP
"Her large dark eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek.",EAP
"But what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglass -- elevated it -- adjusted it -- and then regarded me through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes.",EAP
Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more thoroughly astounded -- astounded only -- not offended or disgusted in the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust.,EAP
"But the whole thing was done with so much quietude -- so much nonchalance -- so much repose- with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in short -- that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise.",EAP
"I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutes -- for five minutes, at the very least, I am sure.",EAP
"This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande.",EAP
"Having satisfied her curiosity -- if such it was -- she dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being turned toward myself, as before.",EAP
"I continued to watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing.",EAP
"Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself.",EAP
"It is needless to say what effect this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my excitable mind.",EAP
"Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had reference to myself.",EAP
"Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance.",EAP
"At the expiration of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul.",EAP
"This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitement -- into an absolute delirium of love-served rather to embolden than to disconcert me.",EAP
"In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze.",EAP
"Watching my opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow.",EAP
"She blushed very deeply -- then averted her eyes -- then slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been noticed -- then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side.",EAP
"I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain.",EAP
"I was greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishment -- of my profound amazement -- my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul -- when, instantly afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head.",EAP
"It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy -- upon my transport- upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart.",EAP
"If ever man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment.",EAP
This was my first love -- so I felt it to be.,EAP
It was love supreme-indescribable.,EAP
"It was ""love at first sight;"" and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned.",EAP
How and why should I doubt it for an instant.,EAP
"What other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful -- so wealthy -- evidently so accomplished -- of so high breeding -- of so lofty a position in society -- in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured was Madame Lalande?",EAP
"Yes, she loved me -- she returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind -- as uncompromising -- as uncalculating -- as abandoned -- and as utterly unbounded as my own!",EAP
"These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain.",EAP
The audience arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened.,EAP
"Quitting Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with Madame Lalande.",EAP
"Having failed in this, on account of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the morrow.",EAP
"This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until ""one"" were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable.",EAP
"But even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay.",EAP
"As the last echo ceased, I stepped into B--'s and inquired for Talbot.",EAP
"""Out,"" said the footman -- Talbot's own.",EAP
"I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces -- ""let me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out.",EAP
"What do you mean?""",EAP
"""Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that's all.",EAP
"He rode over to S--, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he would not be in town again for a week.""",EAP
I stood petrified with horror and rage.,EAP
"I endeavored to reply, but my tongue refused its office.",EAP
"At length I turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the innermost regions of Erebus.",EAP
"It was evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself -- had forgotten it as soon as it was made.",EAP
At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word.,EAP
"There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met.",EAP
"By report she was known, I found, to all- to many by sight -- but she had been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance.",EAP
"These few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning call.",EAP
"While I stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by.",EAP
"""As I live, there she is!""",EAP
"""An angel upon earth!""",EAP
"I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box.",EAP
"""Her companion also wears remarkably well,"" said the one of my trio who had spoken first.",EAP
"""Astonishingly,"" said the second; ""still quite a brilliant air, but art will do wonders.",EAP
"Upon my word, she looks better than she did at Paris five years ago.",EAP
"A beautiful woman still; -- don't you think so, Froissart?",EAP
"-- Simpson, I mean.""",EAP
"said I, ""and why shouldn't she be?",EAP
But compared with her friend she is as a rush -- light to the evening star -- a glow -- worm to Antares.,EAP
"-- why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making discoveries -- original ones, I mean.""",EAP
"And here we separated, while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, of which I caught only the lines- Ninon, Ninon, Ninon a bas- A bas Ninon De L'Enclos!",EAP
"During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was consumed.",EAP
"As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition.",EAP
"As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the country.",EAP
"In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again.",EAP
"This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight.",EAP
"Every day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting ""Not come home yet"" of his footman.",EAP
"Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition little short of madness.",EAP
"Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a Parisian -- had lately arrived from Paris -- might she not suddenly return?",EAP
-- return before Talbot came back -- and might she not be thus lost to me forever?,EAP
The thought was too terrible to bear.,EAP
"Since my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly decision.",EAP
"In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured out my whole heart.",EAP
"I spoke boldly, freely -- in a word, I spoke with passion.",EAP
I concealed nothing -- nothing even of my weakness.,EAP
I alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meeting -- even to the glances which had passed between us.,EAP
"I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct.",EAP
"As a third, I spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a formal introduction.",EAP
"I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances -- of my affluence -- and with an offer of my heart and of my hand.",EAP
In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply.,EAP
After what seemed the lapse of a century it came.,EAP
"Romantic as all this may appear, I really received a letter from Madame Lalande -- the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande.",EAP
"Her eyes -- her magnificent eyes, had not belied her noble heart.",EAP
Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason -- the generous impulses of her nature -- despising the conventional pruderies of the world.,EAP
She had not scorned my proposals.,EAP
She had not sheltered herself in silence.,EAP
She had not returned my letter unopened.,EAP
"She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite fingers.",EAP
"It ran thus: ""Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of his contree so vell as might.",EAP
"It is only de late dat I am arrive, and not yet ave do opportunite for to -- l'etudier.",EAP
"""Vid dis apologie for the maniere, I vill now say dat, helas!- Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true.",EAP
Need I say de more?,EAP
am I not ready speak de too moshe?,EAP
"This noble -- spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed, no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory.",EAP
Still Talbot would not return.,EAP
"could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief?",EAP
"Still, however, he came not.",EAP
He was detained by urgent business -- but would shortly return.,EAP
He begged me not to be impatient -- to moderate my transports -- to read soothing books -- to drink nothing stronger than Hock -- and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid.,EAP
"if he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation?",EAP
"I wrote him again, entreating him to forward one forthwith.",EAP
"My letter was returned by that footman, with the following endorsement in pencil.",EAP
"The scoundrel had joined his master in the country: ""Left S- -- yesterday, for parts unknown -- did not say where -- or when be back -- so thought best to return letter, knowing your handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry.",EAP
"After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal deities both master and valet: -- but there was little use in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint.",EAP
"But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity.",EAP
"Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the end.",EAP
"Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande?",EAP
"Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows.",EAP
"Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.",EAP
"The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance.",EAP
"With a presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands.",EAP
"The valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.",EAP
"As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in French.",EAP
"In this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage.",EAP
At this impatience she smiled.,EAP
She urged the old story of decorum- that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by.,EAP
"I had most imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance- thus that I did not possess it -- thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other.",EAP
"And then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date.",EAP
To wed immediately would be improper -- would be indecorous -- would be outre.,EAP
All this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me.,EAP
"She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness -- of imprudence.",EAP
"She bade me remember that I really even know not who she was -- what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society.",EAP
"She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation -- a will o' the wisp -- a fancy or fantasy of the moment -- a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart.",EAP
"These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us -- and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.",EAP
I replied as best I could -- as only a true lover can.,EAP
"I spoke at length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion -- of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration.",EAP
"In conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course of love -- that course of true love that never did run smooth -- and thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long.",EAP
This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination.,EAP
"She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered.",EAP
"This was a delicate point -- for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made.",EAP
She alluded to the topic of age.,EAP
Was I aware -- was I fully aware of the discrepancy between us?,EAP
"That the age of the husband, should surpass by a few years -- even by fifteen or twenty -- the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband.",EAP
"A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently, alas!",EAP
to a life of unhappiness.,EAP
"Now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my Eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum.",EAP
About all this there was a nobility of soul -- a dignity of candor- which delighted -- which enchanted me -- which eternally riveted my chains.,EAP
I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me.,EAP
"""My sweetest Eugenie,"" I cried, ""what is all this about which you are discoursing?",EAP
Your years surpass in some measure my own.,EAP
The customs of the world are so many conventional follies.,EAP
"To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",EAP
"I am twenty-two, you say, granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three.",EAP
"Now you yourself, my dearest Eugenie, can have numbered no more than -- can have numbered no more than -- no more than -- than -- than -- than-"" Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age.",EAP
"But a Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own.",EAP
"In the present instance, Eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up and presented to her.",EAP
"she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles.",EAP
"""Keep it for my sake -- for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents.",EAP
"Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire.",EAP
"It is now, to be sure, growing rather dark -- but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning.",EAP
"In the meantime, you shall be my escort home to-night.",EAP
My friends are about holding a little musical levee.,EAP
"I can promise you, too, some good singing.",EAP
"We French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old acquaintance.""",EAP
"With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home.",EAP
"The mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste.",EAP
"Of this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day.",EAP
"In about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable shadow.",EAP
"This is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt.",EAP
The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life.,EAP
Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private circle out of Vienna.,EAP
The instrumental performers were many and of superior talents.,EAP
"The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well.",EAP
"At length, upon a peremptory call for ""Madame Lalande,"" she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room.",EAP
"I would have escorted her myself, but felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had better remain unobserved where I was.",EAP
"I was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing.",EAP
The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more.,EAP
I know not how adequately to describe it.,EAP
"It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer.",EAP
It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers.,EAP
"Her utterance of the romance in Otello -- the tone with which she gave the words ""Sul mio sasso,"" in the Capuletti -- is ringing in my memory yet.",EAP
Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous.,EAP
"Her voice embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal composition-ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri.",EAP
"In the final of the Somnambula, she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words: Ah!",EAP
non guinge uman pensiero Al contento ond 'io son piena.,EAP
"Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave, springing over an interval of two octaves.",EAP
"Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance.",EAP
"Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability.",EAP
"Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally unreserved.",EAP
"She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative.",EAP
I concealed nothing -- felt that I had a right to conceal nothing -- from her confiding affection.,EAP
"Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love.",EAP
I touched upon my college indiscretions -- upon my extravagances -- upon my carousals- upon my debts -- upon my flirtations.,EAP
"I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled -- of a chronic rheumatism -- of a twinge of hereditary gout- and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes.",EAP
"""Upon this latter point,"" said Madame Lalande, laughingly, ""you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime.",EAP
"By the by,"" she continued, ""have you any recollection-"" and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek -- ""have you any recollection, mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?""",EAP
As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera.,EAP
"""Full well -- alas!",EAP
"do I remember it,"" I exclaimed, pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection.",EAP
"They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high value.",EAP
"mon ami"" she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised me -- ""Eh bien!",EAP
"mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless.",EAP
You have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow.,EAP
"Should I yield to your entreaties -- and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom -- would I not be entitled to demand of you a very -- a very little boon in return?""",EAP
"I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet.",EAP
"""Name it, my beloved, my Eugenie, my own!",EAP
"it is already yielded ere named.""",EAP
"""You shall conquer, then, mon ami,"" said she, ""for the sake of the Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last confessed -- this weakness more moral than physical -- and which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature -- so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character -- and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape.",EAP
"You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision.",EAP
"For, this infirmity you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief.",EAP
"You will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear spectacles; -- ah, hush!",EAP
"-- you have already consented to wear them, for my sake.",EAP
"You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very immense value as a gem.",EAP
"You perceive that, by a trifling modification thus -- or thus -- it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass.",EAP
"It is in the former mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my sake.""",EAP
This request -- must I confess it?,EAP
-- confused me in no little degree.,EAP
"But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of the question.",EAP
"I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could muster at the moment.",EAP
"""It is done -- it is most cheerfully agreed.",EAP
I sacrifice every feeling for your sake.,EAP
"To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I will place it upon my -- upon my nose, -- and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.""",EAP
Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow.,EAP
"Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town.",EAP
"I was to see him at once, and procure a carriage.",EAP
"The soiree would scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved.",EAP
"We were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best.",EAP
"Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses.",EAP
The countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one!,EAP
Those large luminous eyes!,EAP
-- that proud Grecian nose!,EAP
-- those dark luxuriant curls!,EAP
"said I, exultingly to myself, ""this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved!""",EAP
"I turned the reverse, and discovered the words -- ""Eugenie Lalande -- aged twenty-seven years and seven months.""",EAP
"I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune.",EAP
"He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power.",EAP
"In a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage with Madame Lalande -- with Mrs. Simpson, I should say -- and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction Northeast by North, half-North.",EAP
"It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at C--, a village about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route.",EAP
"At four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn.",EAP
"I handed my adored wife out, and ordered breakfast forthwith.",EAP
"In the meantime we were shown into a small parlor, and sat down.",EAP
"It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all.",EAP
"""And now, mon ami,"" said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this train of reflection, ""and now, mon cher ami, since we are indissolubly one -- since I have yielded to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our agreement -- I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestow -- a little promise which it is your intention to keep.",EAP
Yes; full easily do I call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to Eugenie last night.,EAP
You spoke thus: 'It is done!,EAP
-- it is most cheerfully agreed!,EAP
I sacrifice every feeling for your sake.,EAP
"To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it upon my -- upon my nose, -- and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.'",EAP
"These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?""",EAP
"""They were,"" I said; ""you have an excellent memory; and assuredly, my beautiful Eugenie, there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply.",EAP
"they are becoming -- rather -- are they not?""",EAP
"And here, having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them gingerly in their proper position; while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position.",EAP
"I exclaimed, almost at the very instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose -- ""My goodness gracious me!",EAP
"-- why, what can be the matter with these glasses?""",EAP
"and taking them quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again.",EAP
"But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound -- was extreme- indeed I may say it was horrific.",EAP
"What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",EAP
Could I believe my eyes?,EAP
-- that was the question.,EAP
Was that -- was that -- was that rouge?,EAP
"And were those- and were those -- were those wrinkles, upon the visage of Eugenie Lalande?",EAP
"Jupiter, and every one of the gods and goddesses, little and big!",EAP
what -- what -- what -- what had become of her teeth?,EAP
"I dashed the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless with terror and with rage.",EAP
"Now I have already said that Madame Eugenie Lalande -- that is to say, Simpson -- spoke the English language but very little better than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions.",EAP
But rage will carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present care it carried Mrs. Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand.,EAP
"""Vell, Monsieur,"" said she, after surveying me, in great apparent astonishment, for some moments -- ""Vell, Monsieur?",EAP
-- and vat den?,EAP
-- vat de matter now?,EAP
Is it de dance of de Saint itusse dat you ave?,EAP
"If not like me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?""",EAP
"said I, catching my breath -- ""you -- you -- you villainous old hag!""",EAP
"-- me not so ver ole, after all!",EAP
"Me not one single day more dan de eighty-doo.""",EAP
"I ejaculated, staggering to the wall -- ""eighty-two hundred thousand baboons!",EAP
"The miniature said twenty-seven years and seven months!""",EAP
-- dat is so!,EAP
but den de portraite has been take for dese fifty-five year.,EAP
"Ven I go marry my segonde usbande, Monsieur Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take for my daughter by my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart!""",EAP
"""Yes, Moissart,"" said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to speak the truth, was none of the best, -- ""and vat den?",EAP
"Vat you know about de Moissart?""",EAP
"""Nothing, you old fright!",EAP
"-- I know nothing about him at all; only I had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.""",EAP
and vat you ave for say to dat name?,EAP
'Tis ver goot name; and so is Voissart -- dat is ver goot name too.,EAP
"My daughter, Mademoiselle Moissart, she marry von Monsieur Voissart, -- and de name is bot ver respectaable name.""",EAP
"I exclaimed, ""and Voissart!",EAP
"Why, what is it you mean?""",EAP
"-- I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de matter of dat, I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I only tink proper to mean it.",EAP
"My daughter's daughter, Mademoiselle Voissart, she marry von Monsieur Croissart, and den again, my daughter's grande daughter, Mademoiselle Croissart, she marry von Monsieur Froissart; and I suppose you say dat dat is not von ver respectaable name.-"" ""Froissart!""",EAP
"said I, beginning to faint, ""why, surely you don't say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?""",EAP
"""Yes,"" she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and stretching out her lower limbs at great length; ""yes, Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart.",EAP
"But Monsieur Froissart, he vas von ver big vat you call fool -- he vas von ver great big donce like yourself -- for he lef la belle France for come to dis stupide Amerique- and ven he get here he went and ave von ver stupide, von ver, ver stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him -- neither me nor my companion, de Madame Stephanie Lalande.",EAP
"He is name de Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat dat, too, is not von ver respectable name.""",EAP
"Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she lumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she lumped.",EAP
"Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage.",EAP
Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated.,EAP
"I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one of her pigeon-wings, and ""Croissart and Froissart!""",EAP
"as she completed another -- ""Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart!",EAP
"-- why, you ineffable old serpent, that's me -- that's me -- d'ye hear?",EAP
"that's me"" -- here I screamed at the top of my voice -- ""that's me-e-e!",EAP
I am Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart!,EAP
"and if I havn't married my great, great, grandmother, I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!""",EAP
"Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson -- formerly Moissart -- was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother.",EAP
"In her youth she had been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her girlhood.",EAP
"By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passees of the French metropolis.",EAP
"In this respect, indeed, she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated Ninon De L'Enclos.",EAP
"She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the United States, in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husband's -- a Madame Stephanie Lalande.",EAP
"At the opera, my great, great, grandmother's attention was arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself.",EAP
"Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party respecting me.",EAP
"The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and told her who I was.",EAP
The information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed.,EAP
"She returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd accident, I had discovered her identity.",EAP
"When, deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was ""the celebrated widow, Madame Lalande.""",EAP
"In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very naturally turned upon myself.",EAP
"My deficiencies of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown.",EAP
"By way of punishing me for this imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot.",EAP
He purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction.,EAP
"My street inquiries about ""the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,"" were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly after leaving Talbot's hotel will be easily explained, as also their allusion to Ninon De L'Enclos.",EAP
"I had no opportunity of seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age.",EAP
"When ""Madame Lalande"" was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawing-room.",EAP
"Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary.",EAP
"The songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame Stephanie Lalande.",EAP
The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoax -- a sting to the epigram of the deception.,EAP
Its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which I was so especially edified.,EAP
"It is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years.",EAP
"They suited me, in fact, to a T. The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon companion of Talbot's, and no priest.",EAP
"He was an excellent ""whip,"" however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the ""happy couple"" out of town.",EAP
Talbot took a seat at his side.,EAP
"The two scoundrels were thus ""in at the death,"" and through a half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama.",EAP
I believe I shall be forced to call them both out.,EAP
"Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great, grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief, -- but I am the husband of Madame Lalande -- of Madame Stephanie Lalande -- with whom my good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies -- if she ever does -- has been at the trouble of concocting me a match.",EAP
In conclusion: I am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met without SPECTACLES.,EAP
"DURING the autumn of 18--, while on a tour through the extreme southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles of a certain Maison de Sante or private mad-house, about which I had heard much in Paris from my medical friends.",EAP
"As I had never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days before) that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look through the establishment.",EAP
"To this he objected -- pleading haste in the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic.",EAP
"He begged me, however, not to let any mere courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the next.",EAP
"As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and mentioned my fears on this point.",EAP
"He replied that, in fact, unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws.",EAP
"For himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house.",EAP
"I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain.",EAP
"Through this dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the Maison de Sante came in view.",EAP
"It was a fantastic chateau, much dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and neglect.",EAP
"Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and, checking my horse, I half resolved to turn back.",EAP
"I soon, however, grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded.",EAP
"As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and the visage of a man peering through.",EAP
"In an instant afterward, this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight.",EAP
It was Monsieur Maillard himself.,EAP
"He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity, dignity, and authority which was very impressive.",EAP
"My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard's assurance that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw him no more.",EAP
"When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical instruments.",EAP
A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth.,EAP
"At a piano, singing an aria from Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me with graceful courtesy.",EAP
"Her voice was low, and her whole manner subdued.",EAP
"I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not unpleasingly, pale.",EAP
"She was attired in deep mourning, and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and admiration.",EAP
"I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the ""system of soothing"" -- that all punishments were avoided -- that even confinement was seldom resorted to -- that the patients, while secretly watched, were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind.",EAP
"Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane; and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not.",EAP
"I confined my remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic.",EAP
"She replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with which I commenced it.",EAP
"Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit, wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon afterward leaving the room.",EAP
As she departed I turned my eyes in an inquiring manner toward my host.,EAP
"""No,"" he said, ""oh, no -- a member of my family -- my niece, and a most accomplished woman.""",EAP
"""I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,"" I replied, ""but of course you will know how to excuse me.",EAP
"The excellent administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris, and I thought it just possible, you know- ""Yes, yes -- say no more -- or rather it is myself who should thank you for the commendable prudence you have displayed.",EAP
"We seldom find so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some unhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors.",EAP
"While my former system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to inspect the house.",EAP
"Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion I could not rely.""",EAP
"""While your former system was in operation!""",EAP
"I said, repeating his words -- ""do I understand you, then, to say that the 'soothing system' of which I have heard so much is no longer in force?""",EAP
"""It is now,"" he replied, ""several weeks since we have concluded to renounce it forever.""",EAP
"""We found it, sir,"" he said, with a sigh, ""absolutely necessary to return to the old usages.",EAP
"The danger of the soothing system was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much overrated.",EAP
"I believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a fair trial, if ever in any.",EAP
We did every thing that rational humanity could suggest.,EAP
"I am sorry that you could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for yourself.",EAP
"But I presume you are conversant with the soothing practice -- with its details.""",EAP
"What I have heard has been at third or fourth hand.""",EAP
"""I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which the patients were menages-humored.",EAP
We contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad.,EAP
"On the contrary, we not only indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent cures have been thus effected.",EAP
There is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad absurdum.,EAP
"We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves chickens.",EAP
"The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact -- to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact -- and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken.",EAP
"In this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.""",EAP
"""But was this species of acquiescence all?""",EAP
"We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind, such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards, certain classes of books, and so forth.",EAP
"We affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder, and the word 'lunacy' was never employed.",EAP
A great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others.,EAP
"To repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to gain him body and soul.",EAP
"In this way we were enabled to dispense with an expensive body of keepers.""",EAP
"""And you had no punishments of any kind?""",EAP
"""And you never confined your patients?""",EAP
"Now and then, the malady of some individual growing to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends -- for with the raging maniac we have nothing to do.",EAP
"He is usually removed to the public hospitals.""",EAP
"""And you have now changed all this -- and you think for the better?""",EAP
"The system had its disadvantages, and even its dangers.",EAP
"It is now, happily, exploded throughout all the Maisons de Sante of France.""",EAP
"""I am very much surprised,"" I said, ""at what you tell me; for I made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for mania existed in any portion of the country.""",EAP
"""You are young yet, my friend,"" replied my host, ""but the time will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others.",EAP
"Believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see.",EAP
"Now about our Maisons de Sante, it is clear that some ignoramus has misled you.",EAP
"After dinner, however, when you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy to take you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.""",EAP
"I inquired -- ""one of your own invention?""",EAP
"""I am proud,"" he replied, ""to acknowledge that it is -- at least in some measure.""",EAP
"In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of the place.",EAP
"""I cannot let you see my patients,"" he said, ""just at present.",EAP
To a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner.,EAP
"I can give you some veal a la Menehoult, with cauliflowers in veloute sauce -- after that a glass of Clos de Vougeot -- then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.""",EAP
"At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a large salle a manger, where a very numerous company were assembled -- twenty-five or thirty in all.",EAP
"They were, apparently, people of rank-certainly of high breeding -- although their habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle cour.",EAP
I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day.,EAP
"Many females, for example, whose age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings, bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare.",EAP
"I observed, too, that very few of the dresses were well made -- or, at least, that very few of them fitted the wearers.",EAP
"In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale, with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression.",EAP
"When I had first seen her, she was attired, most becomingly, in deep mourning.",EAP
"There was an air of oddity, in short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first, caused me to recur to my original idea of the ""soothing system,"" and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people, with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled.",EAP
"The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about it.",EAP
"For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a carpet is frequently dispensed with.",EAP
"The windows, too, were without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of our ordinary shop-shutters.",EAP
"The apartment, I observed, formed, in itself, a wing of the chateau, and thus the windows were on three sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other.",EAP
There were no less than ten windows in all.,EAP
The table was superbly set out.,EAP
"It was loaded with plate, and more than loaded with delicacies.",EAP
The profusion was absolutely barbaric.,EAP
There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim.,EAP
"Never, in all my life, had I witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of life.",EAP
"There seemed very little taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was possible to find a place.",EAP
"There were several active servants in attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes, trombones, and a drum.",EAP
"These fellows annoyed me very much, at intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises, which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.",EAP
"Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing I saw -- but then the world is made up of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts of conventional customs.",EAP
"I had travelled, too, so much, as to be quite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite, did justice to the good cheer set before me.",EAP
"The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general.",EAP
"The ladies, as usual, talked a great deal.",EAP
I soon found that nearly all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of good-humored anecdote in himself.,EAP
"He seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a Maison de Sante; and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a favorite one with all present.",EAP
"A great many amusing stories were told, having reference to the whims of the patients.",EAP
"""We had a fellow here once,"" said a fat little gentleman, who sat at my right, -- ""a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the way, is it not especially singular how often this particular crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic?",EAP
There is scarcely an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot.,EAP
"Our gentleman was a Britannia -- ware tea-pot, and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.""",EAP
"""And then,"" said a tall man just opposite, ""we had here, not long ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkey -- which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite true.",EAP
He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep him within bounds.,EAP
For a long time he would eat nothing but thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon his eating nothing else.,EAP
"Then he was perpetually kicking out his heels-so-so-"" ""Mr. De Kock!",EAP
"I will thank you to behave yourself!""",EAP
"here interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker.",EAP
"""Please keep your feet to yourself!",EAP
You have spoiled my brocade!,EAP
"Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",EAP
Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this.,EAP
"Upon my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself.",EAP
"Your acting is very natural, as I live.""",EAP
"replied Monsieur De Kock, thus addressed -- ""a thousand pardons!",EAP
I had no intention of offending.,EAP
"Ma'm'selle Laplace -- Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of taking wine with you.""",EAP
"Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much ceremony, and took wine with Ma'm'selle Laplace.",EAP
"""Allow me, mon ami,"" now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing myself, ""allow me to send you a morsel of this veal a la St. Menhoult -- you will find it particularly fine.""",EAP
"At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher, containing what I supposed to be the ""monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.""",EAP
"A closer scrutiny assured me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English fashion of dressing a hare.",EAP
"""Thank you, no,"" I replied; ""to say the truth, I am not particularly partial to veal a la St. -- what is it?",EAP
-- for I do not find that it altogether agrees with me.,EAP
"I will change my plate, however, and try some of the rabbit.""",EAP
"There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit -- a very delicious morceau, which I can recommend.",EAP
"""Pierre,"" cried the host, ""change this gentleman's plate, and give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.""",EAP
"""Why, thank you -- upon second thoughts, no.",EAP
"I will just help myself to some of the ham.""",EAP
"There is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the tables of these people of the province.",EAP
"I will have none of their rabbit au-chat -- and, for the matter of that, none of their cat-au-rabbit either.",EAP
"""And then,"" said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken off, -- ""and then, among other oddities, we had a patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg.""",EAP
"""He was a great fool, beyond doubt,"" interposed some one, ""but not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know, with the exception of this strange gentleman.",EAP
"I mean the man who took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.""",EAP
"Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of champagne.",EAP
"This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.",EAP
"""And then there was an ignoramus,"" said he, ""who mistook himself for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree.",EAP
"I wish you could have seen him, sir,"" -- here the speaker addressed myself -- ""it would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on.",EAP
"Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only observe that it is a pity he was not.",EAP
His croak thus -- o-o-o-o-gh -- o-o-o-o-gh!,EAP
"was the finest note in the world -- B flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus -- after taking a glass or two of wine -- and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus, why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.""",EAP
"""I have no doubt of it,"" I said.",EAP
"""And then,"" said somebody else, ""then there was Petit Gaillard, who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb.""",EAP
"""And then there was Jules Desoulieres, who was a very singular genius, indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin.",EAP
He persecuted the cook to make him up into pies -- a thing which the cook indignantly refused to do.,EAP
"For my part, I am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie a la Desoulieres would not have been very capital eating indeed!""",EAP
said I; and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur Maillard.,EAP
"said that gentleman -- ""he!",EAP
-- very good indeed!,EAP
"You must not be astonished, mon ami; our friend here is a wit -- a drole -- you must not understand him to the letter.""",EAP
"""And then,"" said some other one of the party, -- ""then there was Bouffon Le Grand -- another extraordinary personage in his way.",EAP
"He grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two heads.",EAP
"One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the other he imagined a composite one, being Demosthenes' from the top of the forehead to the mouth, and Lord Brougham's from the mouth to the chin.",EAP
It is not impossible that he was wrong; but he would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a man of great eloquence.,EAP
"He had an absolute passion for oratory, and could not refrain from display.",EAP
"For example, he used to leap upon the dinner-table thus, and -- and-"" Here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear, upon which he ceased talking with great suddenness, and sank back within his chair.",EAP
"""And then,"" said the friend who had whispered, ""there was Boullard, the tee-totum.",EAP
"I call him the tee-totum because, in fact, he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet, that he had been converted into a tee-totum.",EAP
You would have roared with laughter to see him spin.,EAP
"He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this manner -- so- Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper, performed an exactly similar office for himself.",EAP
"""But then,"" cried the old lady, at the top of her voice, ""your Monsieur Boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at best; for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum?",EAP
The thing is absurd.,EAP
"Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person, as you know.",EAP
"She had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common sense, and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance.",EAP
"She found, upon mature deliberation, that, by some accident, she had been turned into a chicken-cock; but, as such, she behaved with propriety.",EAP
"She flapped her wings with prodigious effect -- so -- so -- and, as for her crow, it was delicious!",EAP
"""Madame Joyeuse, I will thank you to behave yourself!""",EAP
"here interrupted our host, very angrily.",EAP
"""You can either conduct yourself as a lady should do, or you can quit the table forthwith-take your choice.""",EAP
"The lady (whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame Joyeuse, after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just given) blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof.",EAP
"She hung down her head, and said not a syllable in reply.",EAP
But another and younger lady resumed the theme.,EAP
It was my beautiful girl of the little parlor.,EAP
"""Oh, Madame Joyeuse was a fool!""",EAP
"she exclaimed, ""but there was really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugenie Salsafette.",EAP
"She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes.",EAP
"It is a thing very easily done, after all.",EAP
"You have only to do so -- and then so -- so -- so -- and then so -- so -- so -- and then so -- so -- and then- ""Mon dieu!",EAP
here cried a dozen voices at once.,EAP
"""What are you about?",EAP
-- that is sufficient!,EAP
"-- we see, very plainly, how it is done!",EAP
"and several persons were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma'm'selle Salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean Venus, when the point was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud screams, or yells, from some portion of the main body of the chateau.",EAP
"My nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but the rest of the company I really pitied.",EAP
I never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life.,EAP
"They all grew as pale as so many corpses, and, shrinking within their seats, sat quivering and gibbering with terror, and listening for a repetition of the sound.",EAP
"It came again -- louder and seemingly nearer -- and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished.",EAP
"At this apparent dying away of the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained, and all was life and anecdote as before.",EAP
I now ventured to inquire the cause of the disturbance.,EAP
"""A mere bagtelle,"" said Monsieur Maillard.",EAP
"""We are used to these things, and care really very little about them.",EAP
"The lunatics, every now and then, get up a howl in concert; one starting another, as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at night.",EAP
"It occasionally happens, however, that the concerto yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose, when, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.""",EAP
"""And how many have you in charge?""",EAP
"""At present we have not more than ten, altogether.""",EAP
"""Principally females, I presume?""",EAP
"""Oh, no -- every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell you.""",EAP
"I have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of the gentler sex.""",EAP
"""It is generally so, but not always.",EAP
"Some time ago, there were about twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less than eighteen were women; but, lately, matters have changed very much, as you see.""",EAP
"""Yes -- have changed very much, as you see,"" here interrupted the gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma'm'selle Laplace.",EAP
"""Yes -- have changed very much, as you see!""",EAP
chimed in the whole company at once.,EAP
"""Hold your tongues, every one of you!""",EAP
"said my host, in a great rage.",EAP
Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute.,EAP
"As for one lady, she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to the letter, and thrusting out her tongue, which was an excessively long one, held it very resignedly, with both hands, until the end of the entertainment.",EAP
"""And this gentlewoman,"" said I, to Monsieur Maillard, bending over and addressing him in a whisper -- ""this good lady who has just spoken, and who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo -- she, I presume, is harmless -- quite harmless, eh?""",EAP
"ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, ""why -- why, what can you mean?""",EAP
"said I, touching my head.",EAP
"""I take it for granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected, eh?""",EAP
what is it you imagine?,EAP
"This lady, my particular old friend Madame Joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself.",EAP
"She has her little eccentricities, to be sure -- but then, you know, all old women -- all very old women -- are more or less eccentric!""",EAP
"""To be sure,"" said I, -- ""to be sure -- and then the rest of these ladies and gentlemen-"" ""Are my friends and keepers,"" interupted Monsieur Maillard, drawing himself up with hauteur, -- ""my very good friends and assistants.""",EAP
"I asked, -- ""the women and all?""",EAP
"""Assuredly,"" he said, -- ""we could not do at all without the women; they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of their own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous effect; -- something like the fascination of the snake, you know.""",EAP
"""To be sure,"" said I, -- ""to be sure!",EAP
"They behave a little odd, eh?",EAP
"-- they are a little queer, eh?",EAP
"-- don't you think so?""",EAP
"-- why, do you really think so?",EAP
"We are not very prudish, to be sure, here in the South -- do pretty much as we please -- enjoy life, and all that sort of thing, you know-"" ""To be sure,"" said I, -- ""to be sure.""",EAP
"And then, perhaps, this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady, you know -- a little strong -- you understand, eh?""",EAP
"""To be sure,"" said I, -- ""to be sure.",EAP
"By the bye, Monsieur, did I understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous severity?""",EAP
"Our confinement is necessarily close; but the treatment -- the medical treatment, I mean -- is rather agreeable to the patients than otherwise.""",EAP
"""And the new system is one of your own invention?""",EAP
"Some portions of it are referable to Professor Tarr, of whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the celebrated Fether, with whom, if I mistake not, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance.""",EAP
"""I am quite ashamed to confess,"" I replied, ""that I have never even heard the names of either gentleman before.""",EAP
"ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair abruptly, and uplifting his hands.",EAP
"""I surely do not hear you aright!",EAP
"You did not intend to say, eh?",EAP
"that you had never heard either of the learned Doctor Tarr, or of the celebrated Professor Fether?""",EAP
"""I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,"" I replied; ""but the truth should be held inviolate above all things.",EAP
"Nevertheless, I feel humbled to the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of these, no doubt, extraordinary men.",EAP
"I will seek out their writings forthwith, and peruse them with deliberate care.",EAP
"Monsieur Maillard, you have really -- I must confess it -- you have really -- made me ashamed of myself!""",EAP
And this was the fact.,EAP
"""Say no more, my good young friend,"" he said kindly, pressing my hand, -- ""join me now in a glass of Sauterne.""",EAP
The company followed our example without stint.,EAP
"They chatted -- they jested -- they laughed -- they perpetrated a thousand absurdities -- the fiddles shrieked -- the drum row-de-dowed -- the trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris -- and the whole scene, growing gradually worse and worse, as the wines gained the ascendancy, became at length a sort of pandemonium in petto.",EAP
"In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard and myself, with some bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us, continued our conversation at the top of the voice.",EAP
A word spoken in an ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish from the bottom of Niagra Falls.,EAP
"""And, sir,"" said I, screaming in his ear, ""you mentioned something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing.",EAP
"""Yes,"" he replied, ""there was, occasionally, very great danger indeed.",EAP
"There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and, in my opinion as well as in that of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether, it is never safe to permit them to run at large unattended.",EAP
"A lunatic may be 'soothed,' as it is called, for a time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become obstreperous.",EAP
"His cunning, too, is proverbial and great.",EAP
"If he has a project in view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of mind.",EAP
"When a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high time to put him in a straitjacket.""",EAP
"""But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your own experience -- during your control of this house -- have you had practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic?""",EAP
-- in my own experience?,EAP
"-- why, I may say, yes.",EAP
"For example: -- no very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this very house.",EAP
"The 'soothing system,' you know, was then in operation, and the patients were at large.",EAP
"They behaved remarkably well-especially so, any one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact, that the fellows behaved so remarkably well.",EAP
"And, sure enough, one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had usurped the offices of the keepers.""",EAP
"""You don't tell me so!",EAP
"I never heard of any thing so absurd in my life!""",EAP
"""Fact -- it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow -- a lunatic -- who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before -- of lunatic government, I mean.",EAP
"He wished to give his invention a trial, I suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers.""",EAP
"""And he really succeeded?""",EAP
"""No doubt of it.",EAP
The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places.,EAP
"Not that exactly either -- for the madmen had been free, but the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I am sorry to say, in a very cavalier manner.""",EAP
"""But I presume a counter-revolution was soon effected.",EAP
This condition of things could not have long existed.,EAP
"The country people in the neighborhood-visitors coming to see the establishment -- would have given the alarm.""",EAP
"""There you are out.",EAP
The head rebel was too cunning for that.,EAP
"He admitted no visitors at all -- with the exception, one day, of a very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid.",EAP
"He let him in to see the place -- just by way of variety, -- to have a little fun with him.",EAP
"As soon as he had gammoned him sufficiently, he let him out, and sent him about his business.""",EAP
"""And how long, then, did the madmen reign?""",EAP
"""Oh, a very long time, indeed -- a month certainly -- how much longer I can't precisely say.",EAP
"In the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly season of it -- that you may swear.",EAP
"They doffed their own shabby clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels.",EAP
The cellars of the chateau were well stocked with wine; and these madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it.,EAP
"They lived well, I can tell you.""",EAP
"""And the treatment -- what was the particular species of treatment which the leader of the rebels put into operation?""",EAP
"""Why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as I have already observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better treatment than that which it superseded.",EAP
"It was a very capital system indeed -- simple -- neat -- no trouble at all -- in fact it was delicious it was Here my host's observations were cut short by another series of yells, of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us.",EAP
"This time, however, they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching.",EAP
"I ejaculated -- ""the lunatics have most undoubtedly broken loose.""",EAP
"""I very much fear it is so,"" replied Monsieur Maillard, now becoming excessively pale.",EAP
"He had scarcely finished the sentence, before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows; and, immediately afterward, it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room.",EAP
"The door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge-hammer, and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence.",EAP
A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued.,EAP
"Monsieur Maillard, to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the side-board.",EAP
I had expected more resolution at his hands.,EAP
"The members of the orchestra, who, for the last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty, now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments, and, scrambling upon their table, broke out, with one accord, into, ""Yankee Doodle,"" which they performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an energy superhuman, during the whole of the uproar.",EAP
"Meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and glasses, leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been restrained from leaping there before.",EAP
"As soon as he fairly settled himself, he commenced an oration, which, no doubt, was a very capital one, if it could only have been heard.",EAP
"At the same moment, the man with the teetotum predilection, set himself to spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and with arms outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that happened to get in his way.",EAP
"And now, too, hearing an incredible popping and fizzing of champagne, I discovered at length, that it proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner.",EAP
"And then, again, the frog-man croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every note that he uttered.",EAP
"And, in the midst of all this, the continuous braying of a donkey arose over all.",EAP
"As for my old friend, Madame Joyeuse, I really could have wept for the poor lady, she appeared so terribly perplexed.",EAP
"All she did, however, was to stand up in a corner, by the fireplace, and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice, ""Cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!""",EAP
And now came the climax -- the catastrophe of the drama.,EAP
"As no resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was offered to the encroachments of the party without, the ten windows were very speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in.",EAP
"But I shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which I gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down among us pele-mele, fighting, stamping, scratching, and howling, there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be Chimpanzees, Ourang-Outangs, or big black baboons of the Cape of Good Hope.",EAP
I received a terrible beating -- after which I rolled under a sofa and lay still.,EAP
"After lying there some fifteen minutes, during which time I listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room, I came to same satisfactory denouement of this tragedy.",EAP
"Monsieur Maillard, it appeared, in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion, had been merely relating his own exploits.",EAP
"This gentleman had, indeed, some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the establishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient.",EAP
This fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me.,EAP
"The keepers, ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered, were first well tarred, then -- carefully feathered, and then shut up in underground cells.",EAP
"They had been so imprisoned for more than a month, during which period Monsieur Maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers (which constituted his ""system""), but some bread and abundance of water.",EAP
The latter was pumped on them daily.,EAP
"At length, one escaping through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest.",EAP
"The ""soothing system,"" with important modifications, has been resumed at the chateau; yet I cannot help agreeing with Monsieur Maillard, that his own ""treatment"" was a very capital one of its kind.",EAP
"As he justly observed, it was ""simple -- neat -- and gave no trouble at all -- not the least.""",EAP
"I have only to add that, although I have searched every library in Europe for the works of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, I have, up to the present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at procuring an edition.",EAP
"THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge.",EAP
"You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat.",EAP
"At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk.",EAP
I must not only punish but punish with impunity.,EAP
A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser.,EAP
It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.,EAP
It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will.,EAP
"I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.",EAP
He had a weak point -- this Fortunato -- although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.,EAP
He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.,EAP
Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.,EAP
"For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires.",EAP
"In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.",EAP
"In this respect I did not differ from him materially; --I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.",EAP
"It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend.",EAP
"He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.",EAP
The man wore motley.,EAP
"He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.",EAP
I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.,EAP
"I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.",EAP
How remarkably well you are looking to-day.,EAP
"But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""",EAP
"And in the middle of the carnival!""",EAP
"""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter.",EAP
"You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""",EAP
"""I have my doubts.""",EAP
"""And I must satisfy them.""",EAP
"""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi.",EAP
If any one has a critical turn it is he.,EAP
"He will tell me --"" ""Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.""",EAP
"""And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.",EAP
"""Come, let us go.""",EAP
"""My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.",EAP
I perceive you have an engagement.,EAP
"Luchresi--"" ""I have no engagement; --come.""",EAP
"It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted.",EAP
The vaults are insufferably damp.,EAP
"They are encrusted with nitre.""",EAP
"""Let us go, nevertheless.",EAP
The cold is merely nothing.,EAP
You have been imposed upon.,EAP
"And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""",EAP
"Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.",EAP
There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time.,EAP
"I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.",EAP
"These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.",EAP
"I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults.",EAP
"I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed.",EAP
"We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.",EAP
"The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.",EAP
"""The pipe,"" he said.",EAP
"""It is farther on,"" said I; ""but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls.""",EAP
"He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.",EAP
"he asked, at length.",EAP
"""How long have you had that cough?""",EAP
My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.,EAP
"""It is nothing,"" he said, at last.",EAP
"""Come,"" I said, with decision, ""we will go back; your health is precious.",EAP
"You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was.",EAP
You are a man to be missed.,EAP
For me it is no matter.,EAP
"We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.",EAP
"Besides, there is Luchresi --"" ""Enough,"" he said; ""the cough's a mere nothing; it will not kill me.",EAP
"I shall not die of a cough.""",EAP
"""True --true,"" I replied; ""and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily --but you should use all proper caution.",EAP
A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.,EAP
Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.,EAP
"""Drink,"" I said, presenting him the wine.",EAP
He raised it to his lips with a leer.,EAP
"He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.",EAP
"""I drink,"" he said, ""to the buried that repose around us.""",EAP
"""And I to your long life.""",EAP
"He again took my arm, and we proceeded.",EAP
"""These vaults,"" he said, ""are extensive.""",EAP
"""The Montresors,"" I replied, ""were a great and numerous family.""",EAP
"""I forget your arms.""",EAP
"""A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.""",EAP
"""Nemo me impune lacessit.""",EAP
The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.,EAP
My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc.,EAP
"We had passed through long walls of piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs.",EAP
"I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.",EAP
"I said; ""see, it increases.",EAP
It hangs like moss upon the vaults.,EAP
We are below the river's bed.,EAP
The drops of moisture trickle among the bones.,EAP
"Come, we will go back ere it is too late.",EAP
"Your cough --"" ""It is nothing,"" he said; ""let us go on.",EAP
"But first, another draught of the Medoc.""",EAP
I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.,EAP
He emptied it at a breath.,EAP
His eyes flashed with a fierce light.,EAP
He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.,EAP
I looked at him in surprise.,EAP
He repeated the movement --a grotesque one.,EAP
"""You do not comprehend?""",EAP
"""Not I,"" I replied.",EAP
"""Then you are not of the brotherhood.""",EAP
"""You are not of the masons.""",EAP
"""Yes, yes,"" I said; ""yes, yes.""",EAP
"""A mason,"" I replied.",EAP
"""A sign,"" he said, ""a sign.""",EAP
"""It is this,"" I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my roquelaire a trowel.",EAP
"""You jest,"" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.",EAP
"""But let us proceed to the Amontillado.""",EAP
"""Be it so,"" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm.",EAP
He leaned upon it heavily.,EAP
We continued our route in search of the Amontillado.,EAP
"We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.",EAP
At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.,EAP
"Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.",EAP
Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.,EAP
"From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size.",EAP
"Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven.",EAP
"It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.",EAP
"It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess.",EAP
Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.,EAP
"""Proceed,"" I said; ""herein is the Amontillado.",EAP
"As for Luchresi --"" ""He is an ignoramus,"" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels.",EAP
"In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.",EAP
A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite.,EAP
"In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally.",EAP
"From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.",EAP
"Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it.",EAP
He was too much astounded to resist.,EAP
Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.,EAP
"""Pass your hand,"" I said, ""over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre.",EAP
"Indeed, it is very damp.",EAP
Once more let me implore you to return.,EAP
Then I must positively leave you.,EAP
"But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.""",EAP
"ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.",EAP
"""True,"" I replied; ""the Amontillado.""",EAP
As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken.,EAP
"Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar.",EAP
"With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.",EAP
I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off.,EAP
The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess.,EAP
It was not the cry of a drunken man.,EAP
There was then a long and obstinate silence.,EAP
"I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.",EAP
"The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones.",EAP
"When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier.",EAP
The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.,EAP
"I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.",EAP
"A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.",EAP
"For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled.",EAP
"Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me.",EAP
"I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied.",EAP
I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured.,EAP
"I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength.",EAP
"I did this, and the clamourer grew still.",EAP
"It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.",EAP
"I had completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier.",EAP
I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in.,EAP
I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.,EAP
But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.,EAP
"It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato.",EAP
"The voice said-- ""Ha!",EAP
"--a very good joke, indeed --an excellent jest.",EAP
We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo --he!,EAP
--over our wine --he!,EAP
But is it not getting late?,EAP
"Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest?",EAP
"Let us be gone.""",EAP
"""Yes,"" I said, ""let us be gone.""",EAP
"""For the love of God, Montresor!""",EAP
"""Yes,"" I said, ""for the love of God!""",EAP
But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.,EAP
"I called aloud -- ""Fortunato!""",EAP
"I called again -- ""Fortunato!""",EAP
I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within.,EAP
There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.,EAP
My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that made it so.,EAP
I hastened to make an end of my labour.,EAP
I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up.,EAP
Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones.,EAP
For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.,EAP
"At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisieme, No.",EAP
"33, Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain.",EAP
"For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.",EAP
"For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Roget.",EAP
"I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G--, the Prefect of the Parisian police.",EAP
"We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years.",EAP
"We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.",EAP
"""If it is any point requiring reflection,"" observed Dupin, as he forbore to enkindle the wick, ""we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.""",EAP
"""That is another of your odd notions,"" said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling every thing ""odd"" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of ""oddities.""",EAP
"""Very true,"" said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.",EAP
"""And what is the difficulty now?""",EAP
"""Nothing more in the assassination way, I hope?""",EAP
"""Oh no; nothing of that nature.",EAP
"The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd.""",EAP
"""Simple and odd,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""Why, yes; and not exactly that, either.",EAP
"The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether.""",EAP
"""Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,"" said my friend.",EAP
"""What nonsense you do talk!""",EAP
"replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.",EAP
"""Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"who ever heard of such an idea?""",EAP
"""A little too self-evident.""",EAP
"--roared our visitor, profoundly amused, ""oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!""",EAP
"""And what, after all, is the matter on hand?""",EAP
"""Why, I will tell you,"" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair.",EAP
"""I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one.",EAP
"""Or not,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has been purloined from the royal apartments.",EAP
The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it.,EAP
"It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.""",EAP
"""How is this known?""",EAP
"""It is clearly inferred,"" replied the Prefect, ""from the nature of the document, and from the nonappearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; --that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.""",EAP
"""Be a little more explicit,"" I said.",EAP
"""Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable.""",EAP
The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.,EAP
"""Still I do not quite understand,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.""",EAP
"""But this ascendancy,"" I interposed, ""would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.",EAP
"Who would dare--"" ""The thief,"" said G., is the Minister D--, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.",EAP
The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold.,EAP
"The document in question --a letter, to be frank --had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.",EAP
During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.,EAP
"After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table.",EAP
"The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice.",EAP
At this juncture enters the Minister D--.,EAP
"His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret.",EAP
"After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other.",EAP
"Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs.",EAP
"At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.",EAP
"Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow.",EAP
"The minister decamped; leaving his own letter --one of no importance --upon the table.""",EAP
"""Here, then,"" said Dupin to me, ""you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete --the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.""",EAP
"""Yes,"" replied the Prefect; ""and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent.",EAP
"The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.",EAP
"But this, of course, cannot be done openly.",EAP
"In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me.""",EAP
"""Than whom,"" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, ""no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.""",EAP
"""You flatter me,"" replied the Prefect; ""but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.""",EAP
"""It is clear,"" said I, ""as you observe, that the letter is still in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power.",EAP
"With the employment the power departs.""",EAP
"""True,"" said G. ""and upon this conviction I proceeded.",EAP
My first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.,EAP
"Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.""",EAP
"""But,"" said I, ""you are quite au fait in these investigations.",EAP
"The Parisian police have done this thing often before.""",EAP
"""Oh yes; and for this reason I did not despair.",EAP
"The habits of the minister gave me, too, a great advantage.",EAP
He is frequently absent from home all night.,EAP
His servants are by no means numerous.,EAP
"They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk.",EAP
"I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris.",EAP
"For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D-- Hotel.",EAP
"My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous.",EAP
So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself.,EAP
"I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.""",EAP
"""But is it not possible,"" I suggested, ""that although the letter may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?""",EAP
"""This is barely possible,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D-- is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document --its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice --a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.""",EAP
"""Its susceptibility of being produced?""",EAP
"""That is to say, of being destroyed,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""True,"" I observed; ""the paper is clearly then upon the premises.",EAP
"As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the question.""",EAP
"""Entirely,"" said the Prefect.",EAP
"""He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.",EAP
"""You might have spared yourself this trouble,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""D--, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.""",EAP
"""Not altogether a fool,"" said G., ""but then he's a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool.""",EAP
"""True,"" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, ""although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself.""",EAP
"""Suppose you detail,"" said I, ""the particulars of your search.""",EAP
"""Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched every where.",EAP
I have had long experience in these affairs.,EAP
"I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each.",EAP
"We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment.",EAP
"We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible.",EAP
Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind.,EAP
The thing is so plain.,EAP
There is a certain amount of bulk --of space --to be accounted for in every cabinet.,EAP
Then we have accurate rules.,EAP
The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us.,EAP
After the cabinets we took the chairs.,EAP
The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.,EAP
"From the tables we removed the tops.""",EAP
"""Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced.",EAP
"The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.""",EAP
"""But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?""",EAP
"""By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it.",EAP
"Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise.""",EAP
"""But you could not have removed --you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention.",EAP
"A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example.",EAP
"You did not take to pieces all the chairs?""",EAP
"""Certainly not; but we did better --we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope.",EAP
Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly.,EAP
"A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.",EAP
"Any disorder in the glueing --any unusual gaping in the joints --would have sufficed to insure detection.""",EAP
"""I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and carpets.""",EAP
"""That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself.",EAP
"We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.""",EAP
"""The two houses adjoining!""",EAP
"I exclaimed; ""you must have had a great deal of trouble.""",EAP
"""We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.",EAP
"""You include the grounds about the houses?""",EAP
"""All the grounds are paved with brick.",EAP
They gave us comparatively little trouble.,EAP
"We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed.""",EAP
"""You looked among D--'s papers, of course, and into the books of the library?""",EAP
"""Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers.",EAP
"We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope.",EAP
"Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation.",EAP
"Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.""",EAP
"""You explored the floors beneath the carpets?""",EAP
"We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope.""",EAP
"""And the paper on the walls?""",EAP
"""You looked into the cellars?""",EAP
"""Then,"" I said, ""you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.",EAP
"""I fear you are right there,"" said the Prefect.",EAP
"""And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do?""",EAP
"""To make a thorough re-search of the premises.""",EAP
"""That is absolutely needless,"" replied G--.",EAP
"""I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.""",EAP
"""I have no better advice to give you,"" said Dupin.",EAP
"""You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?""",EAP
"--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external appearance of the missing document.",EAP
"Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.",EAP
"In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before.",EAP
He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation.,EAP
"At length I said,-- ""Well, but G--, what of the purloined letter?",EAP
"I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister?""",EAP
"""Confound him, say I --yes; I made the reexamination, however, as Dupin suggested --but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.""",EAP
"""How much was the reward offered, did you say?""",EAP
"""Why, a very great deal --a very liberal reward --I don't like to say how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter.",EAP
"The fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled.",EAP
"If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.""",EAP
"""Why, yes,"" said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his meerschaum, ""I really --think, G--, you have not exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter.",EAP
"You might --do a little more, I think, eh?""",EAP
"""Why --puff, puff --you might --puff, puff --employ counsel in the matter, eh?",EAP
"Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy?""",EAP
hang him and welcome.,EAP
"But, once upon a time, a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion.",EAP
"Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.",EAP
"""'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?'",EAP
"said Abernethy, 'why, take advice, to be sure.'""",EAP
"""But,"" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, ""I am perfectly willing to take advice, and to pay for it.",EAP
"I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.""",EAP
"""In that case,"" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, ""you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned.",EAP
"When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.""",EAP
The Prefect appeared absolutely thunderstricken.,EAP
"For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, less, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then, apparently in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin.",EAP
"The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect.",EAP
"This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.",EAP
"When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.",EAP
"""The Parisian police,"" he said, ""are exceedingly able in their way.",EAP
"They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand.",EAP
"Thus, when G-- detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D--, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation --so far as his labors extended.""",EAP
"""So far as his labors extended?""",EAP
"""The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection.",EAP
"Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.""",EAP
I merely laughed --but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.,EAP
"""The measures, then,"" he continued, ""were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man.",EAP
"A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs.",EAP
"But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he.",EAP
"I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration.",EAP
"This game is simple, and is played with marbles.",EAP
"One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.",EAP
"If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one.",EAP
The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school.,EAP
Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents.,EAP
"For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are they even or odd?'",EAP
"Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd'; --he guesses odd, and wins.",EAP
"Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before.",EAP
"I will therefore guess even' guesses even, and wins.",EAP
"Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed ""lucky,"" --what, in its last analysis, is it?""",EAP
"""It is merely,"" I said, ""an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent.""",EAP
"""It is,"" said Dupin;"" and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.'",EAP
"This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.""",EAP
"""And the identification,"" I said, ""of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.""",EAP
"""For its practical value it depends upon this,"" replied Dupin; and the Prefect and his cohort fall so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged.",EAP
"They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it.",EAP
"They are right in this much --that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course.",EAP
"This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below.",EAP
"They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency --by some extraordinary reward --they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching their principles.",EAP
"What, for example, in this case of D--, has been done to vary the principle of action?",EAP
"What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches --what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed?",EAP
"Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter, --not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg --but, at least, in some hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg?",EAP
"And do you not see also, that such recherches nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed --a disposal of it in this recherche manner, --is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance --or, what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude, --the qualities in question have never been known to fall.",EAP
"You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's examination --in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect --its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.",EAP
"This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet.",EAP
"All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.""",EAP
"""But is this really the poet?""",EAP
"""There are two brothers, I know; and both have attained reputation in letters.",EAP
The Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus.,EAP
"He is a mathematician, and no poet.""",EAP
"""You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both.",EAP
"As poet and mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect.""",EAP
"""You surprise me,"" I said, ""by these opinions, which have been contradicted by the voice of the world.",EAP
You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries.,EAP
The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.,EAP
"""'Il y a a parier,'"" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, ""'que toute idee publique, toute convention recue, est une sottise, car elle a convenu au plus grand nombre.'",EAP
"The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth.",EAP
"With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra.",EAP
"The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance --if words derive any value from applicability --then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,' 'religio' religion or 'homines honesti,' a set of honorable men.""",EAP
"""You have a quarrel on hand, I see,"" said I, ""with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed.""",EAP
"""I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical.",EAP
"I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study.",EAP
The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity.,EAP
"The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths.",EAP
And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received.,EAP
Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.,EAP
"What is true of relation --of form and quantity --is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example.",EAP
In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole.,EAP
In chemistry also the axiom fails.,EAP
"In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart.",EAP
There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation.,EAP
"But the mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability --as the world indeed imagines them to be.",EAP
"Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.'",EAP
"With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable addling of the brains.",EAP
"In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q.",EAP
"Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.",EAP
"I mean to say,"" continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last observations, ""that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check.",EAP
"I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded.",EAP
"I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant.",EAP
"Such a man, I considered, could not fall to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action.",EAP
He could not have failed to anticipate --and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate --the waylayings to which he was subjected.,EAP
"He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises.",EAP
"His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finally arrive --the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises.",EAP
"I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed --I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister.",EAP
It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment.,EAP
"He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect.",EAP
"I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.",EAP
"You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident.""",EAP
"""Yes,"" said I, ""I remember his merriment well.",EAP
"I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions.""",EAP
"""The material world,"" continued Dupin, ""abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description.",EAP
"The principle of the vis inertiae, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics.",EAP
"It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress.",EAP
"Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of attention?""",EAP
"""I have never given the matter a thought,"" I said.",EAP
"""There is a game of puzzles,"" he resumed, ""which is played upon a map.",EAP
"One party playing requires another to find a given word --the name of town, river, state or empire --any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart.",EAP
"A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other.",EAP
"These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident.",EAP
"But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect.",EAP
"He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.",EAP
"""But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of D--; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search --the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.",EAP
"""Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel.",EAP
"I found D-- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui.",EAP
"He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive --but that is only when nobody sees him.",EAP
"""To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.",EAP
"""I paid special attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books.",EAP
"Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.",EAP
"""At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece.",EAP
"In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter.",EAP
This last was much soiled and crumpled.,EAP
"It was torn nearly in two, across the middle --as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second.",EAP
"It had a large black seal, bearing the D-- cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D--, the minister, himself.",EAP
"It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the upper divisions of the rack.",EAP
"""No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search.",EAP
"To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description.",EAP
"Here the seal was large and black, with the D-- cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S-- family.",EAP
"Here, the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence.",EAP
"But, then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D--, and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document; these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.",EAP
"""I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister, on a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter.",EAP
"In this examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained.",EAP
"In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary.",EAP
"They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold.",EAP
This discovery was sufficient.,EAP
"It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed.",EAP
"I bade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.",EAP
"""The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day.",EAP
"While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a mob.",EAP
"D-- rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out.",EAP
"In the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings; imitating the D-- cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread.",EAP
"""The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket.",EAP
He had fired it among a crowd of women and children.,EAP
"It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard.",EAP
"When he had gone, D-came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view.",EAP
Soon afterwards I bade him farewell.,EAP
The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.,EAP
"""But what purpose had you,"" I asked, in replacing the letter by a fac-simile?",EAP
"Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and departed?""",EAP
"""D--,"" replied Dupin, ""is a desperate man, and a man of nerve.",EAP
"His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests.",EAP
"Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive.",EAP
The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more.,EAP
But I had an object apart from these considerations.,EAP
You know my political prepossessions.,EAP
"In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned.",EAP
For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power.,EAP
"She has now him in hers; since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was.",EAP
"Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction.",EAP
"His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward.",EAP
"It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down.",EAP
In the present instance I have no sympathy --at least no pity --for him who descends.,EAP
"He is the monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius.",EAP
"I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.""",EAP
"did you put any thing particular in it?""",EAP
"""Why --it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank --that would have been insulting.",EAP
"D--, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember.",EAP
"So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clue.",EAP
"He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words--",EAP
I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was.,EAP
He seemed to live only for joking.,EAP
"To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well, was the surest road to his favor.",EAP
Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers.,EAP
"They all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers.",EAP
"Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris.",EAP
"About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of wit, the king troubled himself very little.",EAP
"He had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.",EAP
"He would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the 'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones.",EAP
"At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court.",EAP
"Several of the great continental 'powers' still retain their 'fools,' who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.",EAP
"Our king, as a matter of course, retained his 'fool.'",EAP
"The fact is, he required something in the way of folly -- if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers -- not to mention himself.",EAP
"His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however.",EAP
"His value was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple.",EAP
"Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.",EAP
"But, as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy -- so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool's name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.",EAP
"I believe the name 'Hop-Frog' was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do.",EAP
"In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait -- something between a leap and a wriggle -- a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure.",EAP
"But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question, or any thing else to climb.",EAP
"At such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.",EAP
"I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog originally came.",EAP
"It was from some barbarous region, however, that no person ever heard of -- a vast distance from the court of our king.",EAP
"Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.",EAP
"Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives.",EAP
"Indeed, they soon became sworn friends.",EAP
"Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit of Hop-Frog.",EAP
"On some grand state occasion -- I forgot what -- the king determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called into play.",EAP
"Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.",EAP
The night appointed for the fete had arrived.,EAP
"A gorgeous hall had been fitted up, under Trippetta's eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade.",EAP
The whole court was in a fever of expectation.,EAP
"As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points.",EAP
"Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere -- except in the case of the king and his seven minsters.",EAP
"Why they hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke.",EAP
"More probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds.",EAP
"At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog.",EAP
When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor.,EAP
"He knew that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling.",EAP
"But the king loved his practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it) 'to be merry.'",EAP
"""Come here, Hop-Frog,"" said he, as the jester and his friend entered the room; ""swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention.",EAP
"We want characters -- characters, man -- something novel -- out of the way.",EAP
We are wearied with this everlasting sameness.,EAP
"the wine will brighten your wits.""",EAP
"Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king; but the effort was too much.",EAP
"It happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his 'absent friends' forced the tears to his eyes.",EAP
"Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.",EAP
"roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beaker.",EAP
"-- ""See what a glass of good wine can do!",EAP
"Why, your eyes are shining already!""",EAP
"his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous.",EAP
"He placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the company with a half -- insane stare.",EAP
They all seemed highly amused at the success of the king's 'joke.',EAP
"""And now to business,"" said the prime minister, a very fat man.",EAP
"""Yes,"" said the King; ""Come lend us your assistance.",EAP
"Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of characters -- all of us -- ha!",EAP
"and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.",EAP
Hop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly.,EAP
"""Come, come,"" said the king, impatiently, ""have you nothing to suggest?""",EAP
"""I am endeavoring to think of something novel,"" replied the dwarf, abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.",EAP
"cried the tyrant, fiercely; ""what do you mean by that?",EAP
"You are Sulky, and want more wine.",EAP
"and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.",EAP
"shouted the monster, ""or by the fiends-"" The dwarf hesitated.",EAP
The king grew purple with rage.,EAP
"Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.",EAP
"The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity.",EAP
He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say -- how most becomingly to express his indignation.,EAP
"At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face.",EAP
"The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her position at the foot of the table.",EAP
"There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard.",EAP
"It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.",EAP
"""What -- what -- what are you making that noise for?""",EAP
"demanded the king, turning furiously to the dwarf.",EAP
"The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant's face, merely ejaculated: ""I -- I?",EAP
"How could it have been me?""",EAP
"""The sound appeared to come from without,"" observed one of the courtiers.",EAP
"""I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his cage-wires.""",EAP
"""True,"" replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; ""but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabond's teeth.""",EAP
"Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very repulsive teeth.",EAP
"Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired.",EAP
"The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.",EAP
"""I cannot tell what was the association of idea,"" observed he, very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, ""but just after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face -- just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion -- one of my own country frolics -- often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether.",EAP
"Unfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and-"" ""Here we are!""",EAP
"cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence; ""eight to a fraction -- I and my seven ministers.",EAP
"what is the diversion?""",EAP
"""We call it,"" replied the cripple, ""the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent sport if well enacted.""",EAP
"""We will enact it,"" remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering his eyelids.",EAP
"""The beauty of the game,"" continued Hop-Frog, ""lies in the fright it occasions among the women.""",EAP
roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.,EAP
"""I will equip you as ourang-outangs,"" proceeded the dwarf; ""leave all that to me.",EAP
"The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts -- and of course, they will be as much terrified as astonished.""",EAP
"""Oh, this is exquisite!""",EAP
"I will make a man of you.""",EAP
"""The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling.",EAP
"You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.",EAP
"Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women.",EAP
"The contrast is inimitable!""",EAP
"""It must be,"" said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.",EAP
"His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective enough for his purposes.",EAP
"The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured.",EAP
The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers.,EAP
They were then saturated with tar.,EAP
"At this stage of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flax.",EAP
A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar.,EAP
A long chain was now procured.,EAP
"First, it was passed about the waist of the king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the same manner.",EAP
"When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo.",EAP
"The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top.",EAP
"At night (the season for which the apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.",EAP
"The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta's superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf.",EAP
"At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed.",EAP
"Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier.",EAP
"Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the wall -- some fifty or sixty altogether.",EAP
"The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before making their appearance.",EAP
"No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together -- for the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered.",EAP
"The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of the king with glee.",EAP
"As had been anticipated, there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs.",EAP
"Many of the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood.",EAP
"As it was, a general rush was made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had been deposited with him.",EAP
"While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor.",EAP
"Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course, in immediate contact with the chain.",EAP
"While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles.",EAP
"Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and face to face.",EAP
"The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes.",EAP
"""Leave them to me!""",EAP
"now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din.",EAP
"""Leave them to me.",EAP
I fancy I know them.,EAP
"If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.""",EAP
"Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and still screaming: ""I shall soon find out who they are!""",EAP
"And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet -- dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor.",EAP
"Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were.",EAP
"So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence, of about a minute's duration, ensued.",EAP
"It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta.",EAP
"But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued.",EAP
"It came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions.",EAP
said at length the infuriated jester.,EAP
"I begin to see who these people are now!""",EAP
"Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame.",EAP
"In less than half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.",EAP
"At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.",EAP
"The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke: ""I now see distinctly.""",EAP
"he said, ""what manner of people these maskers are.",EAP
"They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors, -- a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage.",EAP
"As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester -- and this is my last jest.""",EAP
"Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete.",EAP
"The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass.",EAP
"The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light.",EAP
"It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again.",EAP
WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag.,EAP
For some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.,EAP
"""Not long ago,"" said he at length, ""and I could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons ; but, about three years past, there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man -- or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of -- and the six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul.",EAP
You suppose me a very old man -- but I am not.,EAP
"It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow.",EAP
"Do you know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy ?""",EAP
"The ""little cliff,"" upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge -- this ""little cliff"" arose, a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us.",EAP
Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink.,EAP
"In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at the sky -- while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds.",EAP
It was long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.,EAP
"""You must get over these fancies,"" said the guide, ""for I have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event I mentioned -- and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye.""",EAP
"""We are now,"" he continued, in that particularizing manner which distinguished him -- ""we are now close upon the Norwegian coast -- in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude -- in the great province of Nordland -- and in the dreary district of Lofoden.",EAP
"The mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy.",EAP
"Now raise yourself up a little higher -- hold on to the grass if you feel giddy -- so -- and look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.""",EAP
"I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's account of the Mare Tenebrarum.",EAP
A panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive.,EAP
"To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever.",EAP
"Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island ; or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.",EAP
"About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.",EAP
"The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it.",EAP
"Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction -- as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise.",EAP
Of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.,EAP
"""The island in the distance,"" resumed the old man, ""is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh.",EAP
The one midway is Moskoe.,EAP
That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren.,EAP
"Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm.",EAP
"Farther off -- between Moskoe and Vurrgh -- are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm.",EAP
"These are the true names of the places -- but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can understand.",EAP
Do you hear anything ?,EAP
"Do you see any change in the water ?""",EAP
"We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit.",EAP
"As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward.",EAP
"Even while I gazed, this current acquired a monstrous velocity.",EAP
Each moment added to its speed -- to its headlong impetuosity.,EAP
"In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury ; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway.",EAP
"Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion -- heaving, boiling, hissing -- gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.",EAP
"In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical alteration.",EAP
"The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before.",EAP
"These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.",EAP
"Suddenly -- very suddenly -- this assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile in diameter.",EAP
"The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray ; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.",EAP
"The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked.",EAP
"I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation.",EAP
"""This,"" said I at length, to the old man -- ""this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstr�m.""",EAP
"""So it is sometimes termed,"" said he.",EAP
"""We Norwegians call it the Moskoe-str�m, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.""",EAP
The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I saw.,EAP
"That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene -- or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder.",EAP
"I am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time ; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm.",EAP
"There are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.",EAP
"""Between Lofoden and Moskoe,"" he says, ""the depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms ; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather.",EAP
"When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity ; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts ; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks ; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again.",EAP
"But these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning.",EAP
"When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it.",EAP
"Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach.",EAP
"It likewise happens frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves.",EAP
"A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore.",EAP
"Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them.",EAP
"This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro.",EAP
This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea -- it being constantly high and low water every six hours.,EAP
"In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.""",EAP
"In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex.",EAP
"The ""forty fathoms"" must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden.",EAP
The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-str�m must be immeasurably greater ; and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of Helseggen.,EAP
"Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of the line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.",EAP
"The attempts to account for the phenomenon -- some of which, I remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal -- now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect.",EAP
"The idea generally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands, ""have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract ; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.""",EAP
-- These are the words of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.,EAP
"Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelstr�m is an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part -- the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.",EAP
"This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented ; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own.",EAP
"As to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it ; and here I agreed with him -- for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.",EAP
"""You have had a good look at the whirl now,"" said the old man, ""and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-str�m.""",EAP
"I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.",EAP
"""Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh.",EAP
"In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as I tell you.",EAP
The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward.,EAP
"There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk, and therefore these places are preferred.",EAP
"The choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater abundance ; so that we often got in a single day, what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week.",EAP
"In fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation -- the risk of life standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital.",EAP
"""We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this ; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the Moskoe-str�m, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere.",EAP
"Here we used to remain until nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home.",EAP
We never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming -- one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return -- and we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point.,EAP
"Twice, during six years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here ; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of.",EAP
"Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents -- here to-day and gone to-morrow -- which drove us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.",EAP
"""I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered 'on the grounds' -- it is a bad spot to be in, even in good weather -- but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the Moskoe-str�m itself without accident ; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack.",EAP
"The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable.",EAP
"My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own.",EAP
"These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing -- but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger -- for, after all is said and done, it was a horrible danger, and that is the truth.",EAP
"""It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell you occurred.",EAP
"It was on the tenth day of July, 18__, a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget -- for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens.",EAP
"And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow.",EAP
"""The three of us -- my two brothers and myself -- had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we had ever known them.",EAP
"It was just seven, by my watch, when we weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Str�m at slack water, which we knew would be at eight.",EAP
"""We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it.",EAP
All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen.,EAP
"This was most unusual -- something that had never happened to us before -- and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why.",EAP
"We put the boat on the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.",EAP
"""In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction.",EAP
"This state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about it.",EAP
"In less than a minute the storm was upon us -- in less than two the sky was entirely overcast -- and what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.",EAP
"""Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.",EAP
The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it.,EAP
"We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us ; but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off -- the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.",EAP
"""Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.",EAP
"It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the Str�m, by way of precaution against the chopping seas.",EAP
But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once -- for we lay entirely buried for some moments.,EAP
"How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining.",EAP
"For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast.",EAP
It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this -- which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done -- for I was too much flurried to think.,EAP
"""For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt.",EAP
"When I could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear.",EAP
"Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas.",EAP
"I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm.",EAP
"It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard -- but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror -- for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word 'Moskoe-str�m'!",EAP
"""No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment.",EAP
I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague.,EAP
I knew what he meant by that one word well enough -- I knew what he wished to make me understand.,EAP
"With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Str�m, and nothing could save us!",EAP
"""You perceive that in crossing the Str�m channel, we always went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack -- but now we were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this !",EAP
"'To be sure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack -- there is some little hope in that' -- but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all.",EAP
"I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.",EAP
"""By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains.",EAP
"A singular change, too, had come over the heavens.",EAP
"Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear sky -- as clear as I ever saw -- and of a deep bright blue -- and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I never before knew her to wear.",EAP
"She lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness -- but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!",EAP
"""I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother -- but, in some manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear.",EAP
"Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his finger, as if to say 'listen'!",EAP
"""At first I could not make out what he meant -- but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me.",EAP
I dragged my watch from its fob.,EAP
It was not going.,EAP
"I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean.",EAP
It had run down at seven o'clock!,EAP
"We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Str�m was in full fury!",EAP
"""When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from beneath her -- which appears very strange to a landsman -- and this is what is called riding, in sea phrase.",EAP
"Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly ; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose -- up -- up -- as if into the sky.",EAP
I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high.,EAP
"And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream.",EAP
But while we were up I had thrown a quick glance around -- and that one glance was all sufficient.,EAP
I saw our exact position in an instant.,EAP
"The Moskoe-Str�m whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead -- but no more like the every-day Moskoe-Str�m, than the whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race.",EAP
"If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognised the place at all.",EAP
"As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.",EAP
The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.,EAP
"""It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam.",EAP
"The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt.",EAP
"At the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek -- such a sound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together.",EAP
"We were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl ; and I thought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the abyss -- down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along.",EAP
"The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge.",EAP
"Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.",EAP
It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.,EAP
"""It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it.",EAP
"Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.",EAP
I suppose it was despair that strung my nerves.,EAP
"""It may look like boasting -- but what I tell you is truth -- I began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power.",EAP
I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.,EAP
After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself.,EAP
"I positively felt a wish to explore its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make ; and my principal grief was that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries I should see.",EAP
"These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy a man's mind in such extremity -- and I have often thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little light-headed.",EAP
"""There was another circumstance which tended to restore my self-possession ; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not reach us in our present situation -- for, as you saw yourself, the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge.",EAP
"If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together.",EAP
"They blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflection.",EAP
"But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these annoyances -- just us death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.",EAP
"""How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.",EAP
"We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge.",EAP
All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt.,EAP
"My brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us.",EAP
"As we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp.",EAP
I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act -- although I knew he was a madman when he did it -- a raving maniac through sheer fright.,EAP
"I did not care, however, to contest the point with him.",EAP
"I knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all ; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask.",EAP
"This there was no great difficulty in doing ; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even keel -- only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.",EAP
"Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss.",EAP
"I muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.",EAP
"""As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes.",EAP
"For some seconds I dared not open them -- while I expected instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.",EAP
But moment after moment elapsed.,EAP
"The sense of falling had ceased ; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along.",EAP
"I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.",EAP
"""Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with which I gazed about me.",EAP
"The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.",EAP
"""At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.",EAP
The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld.,EAP
"When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward.",EAP
"In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool.",EAP
"She was quite upon an even keel -- that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water -- but this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam-ends.",EAP
"I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level ; and this, I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.",EAP
"""The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf ; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity.",EAP
"This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom -- but the yell that went up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.",EAP
"""Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had carried us a great distance down the slope ; but our farther descent was by no means proportionate.",EAP
"Round and round we swept -- not with any uniform movement -- but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards -- sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl.",EAP
"Our progress downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.",EAP
"""Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl.",EAP
"Both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves.",EAP
I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors.,EAP
It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom.,EAP
"I now began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our company.",EAP
I must have been delirious -- for I even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below.,EAP
"'This fir tree,' I found myself at one time saying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears,' -- and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before.",EAP
"At length, after making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all -- this fact -- the fact of my invariable miscalculation -- set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.",EAP
"""It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more exciting hope.",EAP
"This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from present observation.",EAP
"I called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-str�m.",EAP
By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way -- so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters -- but then I distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all.,EAP
"Now I could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbed -- that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case might be.",EAP
"I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more rapidly.",EAP
"I made, also, three important observations.",EAP
"The first was, that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their descent -- the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other of any other shape, the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere -- the third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.",EAP
"Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master of the district ; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.'",EAP
"He explained to me -- although I have forgotten the explanation -- how what I observed was, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments -- and showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.",EAP
"* * See Archimedes, ""De Incidentibus in Fluido.""",EAP
"""There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little from their original station.",EAP
"""I no longer hesitated what to do.",EAP
"I resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water.",EAP
"I attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about to do.",EAP
"I thought at length that he comprehended my design -- but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt.",EAP
"It was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay ; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.",EAP
"""The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be.",EAP
"As it is myself who now tell you this tale -- as you see that I did escape -- and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say -- I will bring my story quickly to conclusion.",EAP
"It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below.",EAP
"The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool.",EAP
The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.,EAP
"The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent.",EAP
"By degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise.",EAP
"The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-str�m had been.",EAP
It was the hour of the slack -- but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane.,EAP
"I was borne violently into the channel of the Str�m, and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen.",EAP
A boat picked me up -- exhausted from fatigue -- and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the memory of its horror.,EAP
Those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions -- but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land.,EAP
"My hair which had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see it now.",EAP
They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed.,EAP
I told them my story -- they did not believe it.,EAP
"I now tell it to you -- and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.""",EAP
"""Listen to me,"" said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head.",EAP
"""There is a spot upon this accursed earth which thou hast never yet beheld And if by any chance thou hast beheld it, it must have been in one of those vigorous dreams which come like the Simoon upon the brain of the sleeper who hath lain down to sleep among the forbidden sunbeams --among the sunbeams, I say, which slide from off the solemn columns of the melancholy temples in the wilderness.",EAP
"The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of the river Zaire.",EAP
"And there is no quiet there, nor silence.",EAP
"""The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue --and they flow not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion.",EAP
For many miles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies.,EAP
"They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch towards the heaven their long ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads.",EAP
And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water.,EAP
And they sigh one unto the other.,EAP
"""But there is a boundary to their realm --the boundary of the dark, horrible, lofty forest.",EAP
"There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually.",EAP
But there is no wind throughout the heaven.,EAP
And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound.,EAP
"And from their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews.",EAP
And at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber.,EAP
"And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the grey clouds rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon.",EAP
But there is no wind throughout the heaven.,EAP
And by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither quiet nor silence.,EAP
"""It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having fallen, it was blood.",EAP
"And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies, and the rain fell upon my head --and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.",EAP
"""And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was crimson in color.",EAP
"And mine eyes fell upon a huge grey rock which stood by the shore of the river, and was litten by the light of the moon.",EAP
"And the rock was grey, and ghastly, and tall, --and the rock was grey.",EAP
"Upon its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might read the characters upon the stone.",EAP
But I could not decypher the characters.,EAP
"And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the characters --and the characters were DESOLATION.",EAP
"""And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock, and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the actions of the man.",EAP
"And the man was tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome.",EAP
"And the outlines of his figure were indistinct --but his features were the features of a Deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face.",EAP
"And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.",EAP
"And the moon shone upon his face, and upon the features of his face, and oh!",EAP
they were more beautiful than the airy dreams which hovered about the souls of the daughters of Delos!,EAP
"""And the man sat down upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and looked out upon the desolation.",EAP
"He looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon.",EAP
"And I lay close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man.",EAP
And the man trembled in the solitude --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.,EAP
"""And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies.",EAP
"And the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and of the murmur that came up from among them.",EAP
And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.,EAP
And the man trembled in the solitude --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.,EAP
"""Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass.",EAP
"And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon.",EAP
And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.,EAP
And the man trembled in the solitude --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.,EAP
"""Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where before there had been no wind.",EAP
"And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest --and the rain beat upon the head of the man --and the floods of the river came down --and the river was tormented into foam --and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds --and the forest crumbled before the wind --and the thunder rolled, --and the lightning fell --and the rock rocked to its foundation.",EAP
And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.,EAP
And the man trembled in the solitude -- but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.,EAP
"""Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies.",EAP
And they became accursed and were still.,EAP
"And the moon ceased to totter in its pathway up the heaven --and the thunder died away --and the lightning did not flash --and the clouds hung motionless --and the waters sunk to their level and remained --and the trees ceased to rock --and the water-lilies sighed no more --and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert.",EAP
"And I looked upon the characters of the rock, and they were changed --and the characters were SILENCE.",EAP
"""And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance was wan with terror.",EAP
"And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock, and listened.",EAP
"But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock were SILENCE.",EAP
"And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar off, and I beheld him no more.""",EAP

Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow!,EAP

My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention.,EAP
"Yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray, hereditary halls.",EAP
"Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and in many striking particulars --in the character of the family mansion --in the frescos of the chief saloon --in the tapestries of the dormitories --in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory --but more especially in the gallery of antique paintings --in the fashion of the library chamber --and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library's contents, there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief.",EAP
"The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber, and with its volumes --of which latter I will say no more.",EAP
Here died my mother.,EAP
Herein was I born.,EAP
But it is mere idleness to say that I had not lived before --that the soul has no previous existence.,EAP
--let us not argue the matter.,EAP
"Convinced myself, I seek not to convince.",EAP
"There is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms --of spiritual and meaning eyes --of sounds, musical yet sad --a remembrance which will not be excluded; a memory like a shadow, vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow, too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason shall exist.",EAP
In that chamber was I born.,EAP
"Thus awaking from the long night of what seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairy-land --into a palace of imagination --into the wild dominions of monastic thought and erudition --it is not singular that I gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye --that I loitered away my boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it is singular that as years rolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers --it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my life --wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought.",EAP
"The realities of the world affected me as visions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became, in turn, --not the material of my every-day existence-but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself.",EAP
"Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal halls.",EAP
"Yet differently we grew --I ill of health, and buried in gloom --she agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers the ramble on the hill-side --mine the studies of the cloister --I living within my own heart, and addicted body and soul to the most intense and painful meditation --she roaming carelessly through life with no thought of the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours.",EAP
--I call upon her name --Berenice!,EAP
--and from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound!,EAP
"vividly is her image before me now, as in the early days of her light-heartedness and joy!",EAP
gorgeous yet fantastic beauty!,EAP
sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim!,EAP
Naiad among its fountains!,EAP
"--and then --then all is mystery and terror, and a tale which should not be told.",EAP
"Disease --a fatal disease --fell like the simoom upon her frame, and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of change swept, over her, pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a manner the most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of her person!",EAP
"the destroyer came and went, and the victim --where was she, I knew her not --or knew her no longer as Berenice.",EAP
"Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itself --trance very nearly resembling positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery was in most instances, startlingly abrupt.",EAP
"In the mean time my own disease --for I have been told that I should call it by no other appelation --my own disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form --hourly and momently gaining vigor --and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible ascendancy.",EAP
"This monomania, if I must so term it, consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive.",EAP
"It is more than probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.",EAP
"To muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin, or in the topography of a book; to become absorbed for the better part of a summer's day, in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry, or upon the door; to lose myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat monotonously some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in; --such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.",EAP
Yet let me not be misapprehended.,EAP
"--The undue, earnest, and morbid attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination.",EAP
"It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme condition or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct and different.",EAP
"In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually not frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury, he finds the incitamentum or first cause of his musings entirely vanished and forgotten.",EAP
"In my case the primary object was invariably frivolous, although assuming, through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance.",EAP
"Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre.",EAP
"The meditations were never pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease.",EAP
"In a word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as I have said before, the attentive, and are, with the day-dreamer, the speculative.",EAP
"My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative and inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the disorder itself.",EAP
"I well remember, among others, the treatise of the noble Italian Coelius Secundus Curio ""de Amplitudine Beati Regni dei""; St. Austin's great work, the ""City of God""; and Tertullian ""de Carne Christi,"" in which the paradoxical sentence ""Mortuus est Dei filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum est quia impossibile est"" occupied my undivided time, for many weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation.",EAP
"Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel.",EAP
"And although, to a careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the moral condition of Berenice, would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such was not in any degree the case.",EAP
"In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fall to ponder frequently and bitterly upon the wonder-working means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass.",EAP
"But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind.",EAP
"True to its own character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling changes wrought in the physical frame of Berenice --in the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity.",EAP
"During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had never loved her.",EAP
"In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with me, had never been of the heart, and my passions always were of the mind.",EAP
"Through the gray of the early morning --among the trellised shadows of the forest at noonday --and in the silence of my library at night, she had flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her --not as the living and breathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream --not as a being of the earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being-not as a thing to admire, but to analyze --not as an object of love, but as the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation.",EAP
"And now --now I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to mind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her of marriage.",EAP
"And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon an afternoon in the winter of the year, --one of those unseasonably warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon*, --I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of the library.",EAP
But uplifting my eyes I saw that Berenice stood before me.,EAP
"*For as Jove, during the winter season, gives twice seven days of warmth, men have called this clement and temperate time the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon --Simonides.",EAP
Was it my own excited imagination --or the misty influence of the atmosphere --or the uncertain twilight of the chamber --or the gray draperies which fell around her figure --that caused in it so vacillating and indistinct an outline?,EAP
I could not tell.,EAP
"She spoke no word, I --not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable.",EAP
"An icy chill ran through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her person.",EAP
"its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige of the former being, lurked in any single line of the contour.",EAP
My burning glances at length fell upon the face.,EAP
"The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow temples with innumerable ringlets now of a vivid yellow, and Jarring discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholy of the countenance.",EAP
"The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, and seemingly pupil-less, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips.",EAP
"They parted; and in a smile of peculiar meaning, the teeth of the changed Berenice disclosed themselves slowly to my view.",EAP
"Would to God that I had never beheld them, or that, having done so, I had died!",EAP
"The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my cousin had departed from the chamber.",EAP
"But from the disordered chamber of my brain, had not, alas!",EAP
"departed, and would not be driven away, the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth.",EAP
Not a speck on their surface --not a shade on their enamel --not an indenture in their edges --but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory.,EAP
I saw them now even more unequivocally than I beheld them then.,EAP
"--they were here, and there, and everywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and excessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the very moment of their first terrible development.",EAP
"Then came the full fury of my monomania, and I struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence.",EAP
In the multiplied objects of the external world I had no thoughts but for the teeth.,EAP
For these I longed with a phrenzied desire.,EAP
All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single contemplation.,EAP
"They --they alone were present to the mental eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my mental life.",EAP
I held them in every light.,EAP
I turned them in every attitude.,EAP
I surveyed their characteristics.,EAP
I dwelt upon their peculiarities.,EAP
I pondered upon their conformation.,EAP
I mused upon the alteration in their nature.,EAP
"I shuddered as I assigned to them in imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by the lips, a capability of moral expression.",EAP
"Of Mad'selle Salle it has been well said, ""que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments,"" and of Berenice I more seriously believed que toutes ses dents etaient des idees.",EAP
--ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me!,EAP
--ah therefore it was that I coveted them so madly!,EAP
"I felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace, in giving me back to reason.",EAP
"And the evening closed in upon me thus-and then the darkness came, and tarried, and went --and the day again dawned --and the mists of a second night were now gathering around --and still I sat motionless in that solitary room; and still I sat buried in meditation, and still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy as, with the most vivid hideous distinctness, it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber.",EAP
"At length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause, succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow, or of pain.",EAP
"I arose from my seat and, throwing open one of the doors of the library, saw standing out in the antechamber a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was --no more.",EAP
"She had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and all the preparations for the burial were completed.",EAP
"I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone.",EAP
It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.,EAP
"I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware that since the setting of the sun Berenice had been interred.",EAP
But of that dreary period which intervened I had no positive --at least no definite comprehension.,EAP
"Yet its memory was replete with horror --horror more horrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity.",EAP
"It was a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections.",EAP
"I strived to decypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound, the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears.",EAP
I had done a deed --what was it?,EAP
"I asked myself the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered me, ""what was it?""",EAP
"On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box.",EAP
"It was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, for it was the property of the family physician; but how came it there, upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it?",EAP
"These things were in no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein.",EAP
"The words were the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat, ""Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas.""",EAP
"Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?",EAP
"There came a light tap at the library door, and pale as the tenant of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe.",EAP
"His looks were wild with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low.",EAP
--some broken sentences I heard.,EAP
"He told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night --of the gathering together of the household-of a search in the direction of the sound; --and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave --of a disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing, still palpitating, still alive!",EAP
He pointed to garments;-they were muddy and clotted with gore.,EAP
"I spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand; --it was indented with the impress of human nails.",EAP
He directed my attention to some object against the wall; --I looked at it for some minutes; --it was a spade.,EAP
"With a shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it.",EAP
"But I could not force it open; and in my tremor it slipped from my hands, and fell heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered to and fro about the floor.",EAP
"I CANNOT, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia.",EAP
"Long years have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering.",EAP
"Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown.",EAP
"Yet I believe that I met her first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine.",EAP
Of her family --I have surely heard her speak.,EAP
That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted.,EAP
"in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone --by Ligeia --that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more.",EAP
"And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom.",EAP
Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia?,EAP
"or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no inquiries upon this point?",EAP
or was it rather a caprice of my own --a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion?,EAP
I but indistinctly recall the fact itself --what wonder that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it?,EAP
"And, indeed, if ever she, the wan and the misty-winged Ashtophet of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over mine.",EAP
"There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not.",EAP
It is the person of Ligeia.,EAP
"In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated.",EAP
"I would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall.",EAP
She came and departed as a shadow.,EAP
"I was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder.",EAP
In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her.,EAP
It was the radiance of an opium-dream --an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos.,EAP
Yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen.,EAP
"""There is no exquisite beauty,"" says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty, without some strangeness in the proportion.""",EAP
"Yet, although I saw that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic regularity --although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed ""exquisite,"" and felt that there was much of ""strangeness"" pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of ""the strange.""",EAP
I examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead --it was faultless --how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine!,EAP
"--the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet, ""hyacinthine!""",EAP
I looked at the delicate outlines of the nose --and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection.,EAP
"There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit.",EAP
I regarded the sweet mouth.,EAP
"Here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly --the magnificent turn of the short upper lip --the soft, voluptuous slumber of the under --the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke --the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles.",EAP
"I scrutinized the formation of the chin --and here, too, I found the gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek --the contour which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian.",EAP
And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.,EAP
For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique.,EAP
"It might have been, too, that in these eves of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam alludes.",EAP
"They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race.",EAP
They were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad.,EAP
Yet it was only at intervals --in moments of intense excitement --that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia.,EAP
And at such moments was her beauty --in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps --the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth --the beauty of the fabulous Houri of the Turk.,EAP
"The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length.",EAP
"The brows, slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint.",EAP
"The ""strangeness,"" however, which I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to the expression.",EAP
"Ah, word of no meaning!",EAP
behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual.,EAP
The expression of the eyes of Ligeia!,EAP
How for long hours have I pondered upon it!,EAP
"How have I, through the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to fathom it!",EAP
What was it --that something more profound than the well of Democritus --which lay far within the pupils of my beloved?,EAP
I was possessed with a passion to discover.,EAP
"those large, those shining, those divine orbs!",EAP
"they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.",EAP
"There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact --never, I believe, noticed in the schools --that, in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember.",EAP
"And thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes, have I felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression --felt it approaching --yet not quite be mine --and so at length entirely depart!",EAP
"And (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!)",EAP
"I found, in the commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to theat expression.",EAP
"I mean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia's beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs.",EAP
"Yet not the more could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it.",EAP
"I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly-growing vine --in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water.",EAP
I have felt it in the ocean; in the falling of a meteor.,EAP
I have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people.,EAP
"And there are one or two stars in heaven --(one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the feeling.",EAP
"I have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from books.",EAP
"Among innumerable other instances, I well remember something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness --who shall say?)",EAP
"never failed to inspire me with the sentiment; --""And the will therein lieth, which dieth not.",EAP
"Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor?",EAP
For God is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness.,EAP
"Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.""",EAP
"Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia.",EAP
"An intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence.",EAP
"Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion.",EAP
"And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me --by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness and placidity of her very low voice --and by the fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.",EAP
I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense --such as I have never known in woman.,EAP
"In the classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her at fault.",EAP
"Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy, have I ever found Ligeia at fault?",EAP
"How singularly --how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention!",EAP
"I said her knowledge was such as I have never known in woman --but where breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science?",EAP
"I saw not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage.",EAP
"With how vast a triumph --with how vivid a delight --with how much of all that is ethereal in hope --did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little sought --but less known --that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!",EAP
"How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away!",EAP
Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted.,EAP
"Her presence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed.",EAP
"Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead.",EAP
And now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over which I pored.,EAP
"The wild eyes blazed with a too --too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle emotion.",EAP
I saw that she must die --and I struggled desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael.,EAP
"And the struggles of the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic than my own.",EAP
"There had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors; --but not so.",EAP
Words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the Shadow.,EAP
I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle.,EAP
"would have soothed --I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life, --for life --but for life --solace and reason were the uttermost folly.",EAP
"Yet not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external placidity of her demeanor.",EAP
Her voice grew more gentle --grew more low --yet I would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words.,EAP
"My brain reeled as I hearkened entranced, to a melody more than mortal --to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known.",EAP
"That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary passion.",EAP
"But in death only, was I fully impressed with the strength of her affection.",EAP
"For long hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry.",EAP
How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?,EAP
"--how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour of her making them, But upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate.",EAP
"Let me say only, that in Ligeia's more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas!",EAP
"all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away.",EAP
It is this wild longing --it is this eager vehemence of desire for life --but for life --that I have no power to portray --no utterance capable of expressing.,EAP
"At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before.",EAP
--They were these: Lo!,EAP
'tis a gala night Within the lonesome latter years!,EAP
"An angel throng, bewinged, bedight In veils, and drowned in tears, Sit in a theatre, to see A play of hopes and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully The music of the spheres.",EAP
"Mimes, in the form of God on high, Mutter and mumble low, And hither and thither fly -- Mere puppets they, who come and go At bidding of vast formless things That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings Invisible Wo!",EAP
"--oh, be sure It shall not be forgot!",EAP
"With its Phantom chased forever more, By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in To the self-same spot, And much of Madness and more of Sin And Horror the soul of the plot.",EAP
"But see, amid the mimic rout, A crawling shape intrude!",EAP
A blood-red thing that writhes from out The scenic solitude!,EAP
"--with mortal pangs The mimes become its food, And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs In human gore imbued.",EAP
Out --out are the lights --out all!,EAP
"And over each quivering form, The curtain, a funeral pall, Comes down with the rush of a storm, And the angels, all pallid and wan, Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, ""Man,"" And its hero the Conqueror Worm.",EAP
"half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines --""O God!",EAP
--shall these things be undeviatingly so?,EAP
--shall this Conqueror be not once conquered?,EAP
Are we not part and parcel in Thee?,EAP
Who --who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor?,EAP
"Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.""",EAP
"And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death.",EAP
"And as she breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips.",EAP
"I bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding words of the passage in Glanvill --""Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.""",EAP
"She died; --and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city by the Rhine.",EAP
I had no lack of what the world calls wealth.,EAP
"Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals.",EAP
"After a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair England.",EAP
"The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country.",EAP
"Yet although the external abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within.",EAP
"--For such follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief.",EAP
"Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold!",EAP
"I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams.",EAP
But these absurdities must not pause to detail.,EAP
"Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride --as the successor of the unforgotten Ligeia --the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.",EAP
There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me.,EAP
"Where were the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved?",EAP
"I have said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber --yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment --and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take hold upon the memory.",EAP
"The room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size.",EAP
"Occupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole window --an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice --a single pane, and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within.",EAP
"Over the upper portion of this huge window, extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls of the turret.",EAP
"The ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device.",EAP
"From out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires.",EAP
"Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in various stations about --and there was the couch, too --bridal couch --of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above.",EAP
"In each of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture.",EAP
"But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas!",EAP
the chief phantasy of all.,EAP
"The lofty walls, gigantic in height --even unproportionably so --were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking tapestry --tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window.",EAP
The material was the richest cloth of gold.,EAP
"It was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black.",EAP
But these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point of view.,EAP
"By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect.",EAP
"To one entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk.",EAP
The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperies --giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.,EAP
"In halls such as these --in a bridal chamber such as this --I passed, with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our marriage --passed them with but little disquietude.",EAP
That my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper --that she shunned me and loved me but little --I could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise.,EAP
I loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man.,EAP
"My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!)",EAP
"to Ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed.",EAP
"I revelled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love.",EAP
"Now, then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own.",EAP
"In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned --ah, could it be forever?",EAP
"About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow.",EAP
"The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the turret, which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself.",EAP
She became at length convalescent --finally well.,EAP
"Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether recovered.",EAP
"Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians.",EAP
"With the increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by trivial causes of fear.",EAP
"She spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds --of the slight sounds --and of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly alluded.",EAP
"One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention.",EAP
"She had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance.",EAP
"I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India.",EAP
"She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds which she then heard, but which I could not hear --of motions which she then saw, but which I could not perceive.",EAP
"The wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her (what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those almost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind.",EAP
"But a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless.",EAP
"She appeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call.",EAP
"I remembered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it.",EAP
"But, as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention.",EAP
"I had felt that some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow --a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect --such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade.",EAP
"But I was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to Rowena.",EAP
"Having found the wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the lips of the fainting lady.",EAP
"She had now partially recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person.",EAP
"It was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid.",EAP
If this I saw --not so Rowena.,EAP
"She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour.",EAP
"Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.",EAP
"--Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me.",EAP
"I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer overhead.",EAP
"My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a former night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had seen the faint traces of the shadow.",EAP
"It was there, however, no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed.",EAP
"Then rushed upon me a thousand memories of Ligeia --and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which I had regarded her thus enshrouded.",EAP
"The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the body of Rowena.",EAP
"It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me from my revery.",EAP
--I felt that it came from the bed of ebony --the bed of death.,EAP
I listened in an agony of superstitious terror --but there was no repetition of the sound.,EAP
I strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse --but there was not the slightest perceptible.,EAP
Yet I could not have been deceived.,EAP
"I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within me.",EAP
I resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body.,EAP
Many minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery.,EAP
"At length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids.",EAP
"Through a species of unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I sat.",EAP
Yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession.,EAP
I could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations --that Rowena still lived.,EAP
It was necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants --there were none within call --I had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes --and this I could not venture to do.,EAP
I therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill hovering.,EAP
"In a short period it was certain, however, that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately supervened.",EAP
"I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of Ligeia.",EAP
An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?),EAP
I was a second time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed.,EAP
I listened --in extremity of horror.,EAP
The sound came again --it was a sigh.,EAP
"Rushing to the corpse, I saw --distinctly saw --a tremor upon the lips.",EAP
"In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly teeth.",EAP
Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone.,EAP
"I felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed out.",EAP
There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was even a slight pulsation at the heart.,EAP
The lady lived; and with redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration.,EAP
"I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and used every exertion which experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest.",EAP
"Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.",EAP
"And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia --and again, (what marvel that I shudder while I write,) again there reached my ears a low sob from the region of the ebony bed.",EAP
But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that night?,EAP
"Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the corpse?",EAP
Let me hurry to a conclusion.,EAP
"The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been dead, once again stirred --and now more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any.",EAP
"I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming.",EAP
"The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before.",EAP
"The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenance --the limbs relaxed --and, save that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of Death.",EAP
"But if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of the apartment.",EAP
"I trembled not --I stirred not --for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed --had chilled me into stone.",EAP
I stirred not --but gazed upon the apparition.,EAP
There was a mad disorder in my thoughts --a tumult unappeasable.,EAP
"Could it, indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted me?",EAP
"Could it indeed be Rowena at all --the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine?",EAP
"Why, why should I doubt it?",EAP
The bandage lay heavily about the mouth --but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine?,EAP
"And the cheeks-there were the roses as in her noon of life --yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine.",EAP
"And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",EAP
--but had she then grown taller since her malady?,EAP
What inexpressible madness seized me with that thought?,EAP
"One bound, and I had reached her feet!",EAP
"Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight!",EAP
And now slowly opened the eyes of the figure which stood before me.,EAP
"""Here then, at least,"" I shrieked aloud, ""can I never --can I never be mistaken --these are the full, and the black, and the wild eyes --of my lost love --of the lady --of the LADY LIGEIA.""",EAP
"Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.",EAP
"Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro, Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.",EAP
[Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris.],EAP
"I WAS sick -- sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving me.",EAP
The sentence -- the dread sentence of death -- was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears.,EAP
"After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum.",EAP
It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution -- perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel.,EAP
This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no more.,EAP
"Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an exaggeration!",EAP
I saw the lips of the black-robed judges.,EAP
They appeared to me white -- whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words -- and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness -- of immoveable resolution -- of stern contempt of human torture.,EAP
"I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips.",EAP
I saw them writhe with a deadly locution.,EAP
I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded.,EAP
"I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment.",EAP
And then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table.,EAP
"At first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help.",EAP
"And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave.",EAP
"The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades.",EAP
"Then silence, and stillness, night were the universe.",EAP
I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.,EAP
"What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to describe; yet all was not lost.",EAP
In the deepest slumber -- no!,EAP
In delirium -- no!,EAP
In a swoon -- no!,EAP
In death -- no!,EAP
even in the grave all is not lost.,EAP
Else there is no immortality for man.,EAP
"Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream.",EAP
"Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed.",EAP
"In the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of physical, existence.",EAP
"It seems probable that if, upon reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond.",EAP
And that gulf is -- what?,EAP
How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb?,EAP
"But if the impressions of what I have termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come?",EAP
"He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower -- is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.",EAP
"Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness.",EAP
"These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down -- down -- still down -- till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent.",EAP
"They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness.",EAP
Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!),EAP
"had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil.",EAP
After this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness -- the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.,EAP
"Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound -- the tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating.",EAP
Then a pause in which all is blank.,EAP
"Then again sound, and motion, and touch -- a tingling sensation pervading my frame.",EAP
"Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought -- a condition which lasted long.",EAP
"Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state.",EAP
Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility.,EAP
Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move.,EAP
"And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon.",EAP
Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.,EAP
"So far, I had not opened my eyes.",EAP
"I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound.",EAP
"I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.",EAP
"There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be.",EAP
"I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision.",EAP
I dreaded the first glance at objects around me.,EAP
"It was not that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see.",EAP
"At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes.",EAP
"My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed.",EAP
The blackness of eternal night encompassed me.,EAP
I struggled for breath.,EAP
The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me.,EAP
The atmosphere was intolerably close.,EAP
"I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason.",EAP
"I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.",EAP
The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed.,EAP
Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead.,EAP
"Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence; -- but where and in what state was I?",EAP
"The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial.",EAP
"Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",EAP
This I at once saw could not be.,EAP
Victims had been in immediate demand.,EAP
"Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.",EAP
"A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility.",EAP
"Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every fibre.",EAP
I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions.,EAP
"I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of a tomb.",EAP
"Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead.",EAP
"The agony of suspense grew at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of light.",EAP
I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and vacancy.,EAP
I breathed more freely.,EAP
"It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.",EAP
"And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of Toledo.",EAP
"Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated -- fables I had always deemed them -- but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper.",EAP
"Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me?",EAP
"That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt.",EAP
The mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.,EAP
My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction.,EAP
"It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry -- very smooth, slimy, and cold.",EAP
I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me.,EAP
"This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.",EAP
"I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge.",EAP
"I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure.",EAP
"The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable.",EAP
"I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall.",EAP
"In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit.",EAP
"So, at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness.",EAP
The ground was moist and slippery.,EAP
"I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell.",EAP
My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.,EAP
"Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water.",EAP
"I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity.",EAP
"Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge.",EAP
"Up to the period when I fell I had counted fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight more; -- when I arrived at the rag.",EAP
"There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit.",EAP
"I had met, however, with many angles in the wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for vault I could not help supposing it to be.",EAP
I had little object -- certainly no hope these researches; but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them.,EAP
"Quitting the wall, I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure.",EAP
"At first I proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was treacherous with slime.",EAP
"At length, however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible.",EAP
"I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.",EAP
"I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.",EAP
"In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention.",EAP
"It was this -- my chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing.",EAP
"At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils.",EAP
"I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of ascertaining at the moment.",EAP
"Groping about the masonry just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it fall into the abyss.",EAP
"For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes.",EAP
"At the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.",EAP
"I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped.",EAP
"Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me no more.",EAP
"And the death just avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition.",EAP
"To the victims of its tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or death with its most hideous moral horrors.",EAP
I had been reserved for the latter.,EAP
"By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.",EAP
"Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.",EAP
In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of cowards.,EAP
Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits -- that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.,EAP
Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I again slumbered.,EAP
"Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and a pitcher of water.",EAP
"A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught.",EAP
"It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy.",EAP
A deep sleep fell upon me -- a sleep like that of death.,EAP
"How long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible.",EAP
"By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.",EAP
In its size I had been greatly mistaken.,EAP
The whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty-five yards.,EAP
For some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed!,EAP
"for what could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon?",EAP
"But my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my measurement.",EAP
The truth at length flashed upon me.,EAP
"In my first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the vault.",EAP
"I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps -- thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was.",EAP
"My confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.",EAP
"I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.",EAP
"In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep!",EAP
"The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals.",EAP
The general shape of the prison was square.,EAP
"What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression.",EAP
The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise.,EAP
"The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls.",EAP
"I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere.",EAP
"I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone.",EAP
In the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon.,EAP
All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber.,EAP
"I now lay upon my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood.",EAP
To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle.,EAP
"It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor.",EAP
"I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed.",EAP
I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.,EAP
This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.,EAP
"Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison.",EAP
"It was some thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls.",EAP
In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention.,EAP
"It was the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.",EAP
"There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively.",EAP
While I gazed directly upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in motion.,EAP
In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed.,EAP
"Its sweep was brief, and of course slow.",EAP
"I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder.",EAP
"Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.",EAP
"A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw several enormous rats traversing it.",EAP
"They had issued from the well, which lay just within view to my right.",EAP
"Even then, while I gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the meat.",EAP
From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.,EAP
"It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for in cast my I could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward.",EAP
What I then saw confounded and amazed me.,EAP
The sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard.,EAP
"As a natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater.",EAP
But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended.,EAP
"I now observed -- with what horror it is needless to say -- that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor.",EAP
"Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above.",EAP
"It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.",EAP
I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture.,EAP
"My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents -- the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself -- the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments.",EAP
"The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths.",EAP
"Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me.",EAP
I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.,EAP
"What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel!",EAP
Inch by inch -- line by line -- with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages -- down and still down it came!,EAP
Days passed -- it might have been that many days passed -- ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath.,EAP
The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils.,EAP
I prayed -- I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent.,EAP
"I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar.",EAP
"And then I fell suddenly calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare bauble.",EAP
"There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum.",EAP
"But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure.",EAP
"Upon my recovery, too, I felt very -- oh, inexpressibly sick and weak, as if through long inanition.",EAP
"Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature craved food.",EAP
"With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats.",EAP
"As I put a portion of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy -- of hope.",EAP
Yet what business had I with hope?,EAP
"It was, as I say, a half formed thought -- man has many such which are never completed.",EAP
I felt that it was of joy -- of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its formation.,EAP
In vain I struggled to perfect -- to regain it.,EAP
Long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind.,EAP
I was an imbecile -- an idiot.,EAP
The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length.,EAP
I saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.,EAP
It would fray the serge of my robe -- it would return and repeat its operations -- again -- and again.,EAP
"Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish.",EAP
And at this thought I paused.,EAP
I dared not go farther than this reflection.,EAP
"I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention -- as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of the steel.",EAP
I forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment -- upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves.,EAP
I pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.,EAP
Down -- steadily down it crept.,EAP
I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity.,EAP
To the right -- to the left -- far and wide -- with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger!,EAP
I alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.,EAP
"Down -- certainly, relentlessly down!",EAP
It vibrated within three inches of my bosom!,EAP
"I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm.",EAP
This was free only from the elbow to the hand.,EAP
"I could reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.",EAP
"Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum.",EAP
I might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche!,EAP
Down -- still unceasingly -- still inevitably down!,EAP
I gasped and struggled at each vibration.,EAP
I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep.,EAP
"My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a relief, oh!",EAP
"Still I quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom.",EAP
It was hope that prompted the nerve to quiver -- the frame to shrink.,EAP
It was hope -- the hope that triumphs on the rack -- that whispers to the death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.,EAP
"I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair.",EAP
For the first time during many hours -- or perhaps days -- I thought.,EAP
"It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique.",EAP
I was tied by no separate cord.,EAP
"The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand.",EAP
"But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel!",EAP
The result of the slightest struggle how deadly!,EAP
"Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility!",EAP
Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum?,EAP
"Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, in last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast.",EAP
The surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions -- save in the path of the destroying crescent.,EAP
"Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when I raised food to my burning lips.",EAP
"The whole thought was now present -- feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite, -- but still entire.",EAP
"I proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.",EAP
"For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I lay, had been literally swarming with rats.",EAP
"They were wild, bold, ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey.",EAP
"""To what food,"" I thought, ""have they been accustomed in the well?""",EAP
"They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish.",EAP
"I had fallen into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect.",EAP
In their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.,EAP
"With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.",EAP
At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change -- at the cessation of movement.,EAP
They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the well.,EAP
But this was only for a moment.,EAP
I had not counted in vain upon their voracity.,EAP
"Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle.",EAP
This seemed the signal for a general rush.,EAP
Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops.,EAP
"They clung to the wood -- they overran it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person.",EAP
The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all.,EAP
Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage.,EAP
They pressed -- they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps.,EAP
"They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart.",EAP
"Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over.",EAP
Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage.,EAP
I knew that in more than one place it must be already severed.,EAP
With a more than human resolution I lay still.,EAP
Nor had I erred in my calculations -- nor had I endured in vain.,EAP
I at length felt that I was free.,EAP
The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.,EAP
But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom.,EAP
It had divided the serge of the robe.,EAP
It had cut through the linen beneath.,EAP
"Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve.",EAP
But the moment of escape had arrived.,EAP
At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away.,EAP
"With a steady movement -- cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow -- I slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar.",EAP
"For the moment, at least, I was free.",EAP
-- and in the grasp of the Inquisition!,EAP
"I had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling.",EAP
This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart.,EAP
My every motion was undoubtedly watched.,EAP
"-- I had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other.",EAP
With that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in.,EAP
"Something unusual -- some change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly -- it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment.",EAP
"For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture.",EAP
"During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell.",EAP
"It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor.",EAP
"I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.",EAP
"As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding.",EAP
"I have observed that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite.",EAP
"These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own.",EAP
"Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard as unreal.",EAP
-- Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron!,EAP
A suffocating odour pervaded the prison!,EAP
A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies!,EAP
A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood.,EAP
I gasped for breath!,EAP
There could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors -- oh!,EAP
most demoniac of men!,EAP
I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell.,EAP
"Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm.",EAP
I rushed to its deadly brink.,EAP
I threw my straining vision below.,EAP
The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses.,EAP
"Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw.",EAP
At length it forced -- it wrestled its way into my soul -- it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason.,EAP
for a voice to speak!,EAP
any horror but this!,EAP
"With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands -- weeping bitterly.",EAP
"The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with a fit of the ague.",EAP
There had been a second change in the cell -- and now the change was obviously in the form.,EAP
"As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place.",EAP
But not long was I left in doubt.,EAP
"The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the King of Terrors.",EAP
The room had been square.,EAP
"I saw that two of its iron angles were now acute -- two, consequently, obtuse.",EAP
The fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound.,EAP
In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge.,EAP
But the alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop.,EAP
I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace.,EAP
"""Death,"" I said, ""any death but that of the pit!""",EAP
might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me?,EAP
Could I resist its glow?,EAP
"or, if even that, could I withstand its pressure And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation.",EAP
"Its centre, and of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf.",EAP
I shrank back -- but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.,EAP
At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison.,EAP
"I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair.",EAP
I felt that I tottered upon the brink -- I averted my eyes -- There was a discordant hum of human voices!,EAP
There was a loud blast as of many trumpets!,EAP
There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders!,EAP
The fiery walls rushed back!,EAP
"An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss.",EAP
It was that of General Lasalle.,EAP
The French army had entered Toledo.,EAP
The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.,EAP
"DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.",EAP
"I know not how it was --but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit.",EAP
"I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible.",EAP
"I looked upon the scene before me --upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain --upon the bleak walls --upon the vacant eye-like windows --upon a few rank sedges --and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees --with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium --the bitter lapse into everyday life --the hideous dropping off of the veil.",EAP
"There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart --an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.",EAP
What was it --I paused to think --what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher?,EAP
It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered.,EAP
"I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth.",EAP
"It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down --but with a shudder even more thrilling than before --upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.",EAP
"Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks.",EAP
"Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting.",EAP
"A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country --a letter from him --which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply.",EAP
The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation.,EAP
"The writer spoke of acute bodily illness --of a mental disorder which oppressed him --and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady.",EAP
"It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said --it the apparent heart that went with his request --which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.",EAP
"Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend.",EAP
His reserve had been always excessive and habitual.,EAP
"I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science.",EAP
"I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.",EAP
"It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other --it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the ""House of Usher"" --an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.",EAP
I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment --that of looking down within the tarn --had been to deepen the first singular impression.,EAP
There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition --for why should I not so term it?,EAP
--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself.,EAP
"Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis.",EAP
"And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy --a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me.",EAP
"I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn --a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.",EAP
"Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.",EAP
Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.,EAP
The discoloration of ages had been great.,EAP
"Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves.",EAP
Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation.,EAP
"No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.",EAP
"In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air.",EAP
"Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.",EAP
"Perhaps the eye of a scrutinising observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.",EAP
"Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house.",EAP
"A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall.",EAP
"A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master.",EAP
"Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.",EAP
"While the objects around me --while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy --while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this --I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up.",EAP
"On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family.",EAP
"His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity.",EAP
He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.,EAP
The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.,EAP
The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.,EAP
"The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within.",EAP
"Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.",EAP
Dark draperies hung upon the walls.,EAP
"The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered.",EAP
"Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene.",EAP
I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.,EAP
"An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.",EAP
"Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality --of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world.",EAP
"A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity.",EAP
"We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe.",EAP
"Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!",EAP
It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.,EAP
Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable.,EAP
"A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.",EAP
"And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke.",EAP
"The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eve, above all things startled and even awed me.",EAP
"The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.",EAP
In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence --an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy --an excessive nervous agitation.,EAP
"For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament.",EAP
His action was alternately vivacious and sullen.,EAP
"His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision --that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation --that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.",EAP
"It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him.",EAP
"He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady.",EAP
"It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy --a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off.",EAP
It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations.,EAP
"Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight.",EAP
"He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.",EAP
To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave.,EAP
"""I shall perish,"" said he, ""I must perish in this deplorable folly.",EAP
"Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost.",EAP
"I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results.",EAP
"I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul.",EAP
"I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect --in terror.",EAP
"In this unnerved-in this pitiable condition --I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.""",EAP
"I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition.",EAP
"He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth --in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated --an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.",EAP
"He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin --to the severe and long-continued illness --indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister --his sole companion for long years --his last and only relative on earth.",EAP
"""Her decease,"" he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, ""would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.""",EAP
"While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared.",EAP
I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread --and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings.,EAP
"A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.",EAP
"When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother --but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.",EAP
The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians.,EAP
"A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.",EAP
"Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain --that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.",EAP
"For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.",EAP
"We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar.",EAP
"And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.",EAP
I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.,EAP
"Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way.",EAP
An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all.,EAP
His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears.,EAP
"Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber.",EAP
"From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; --from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words.",EAP
"By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention.",EAP
"If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher.",EAP
"For me at least --in the circumstances then surrounding me --there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.",EAP
"One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words.",EAP
"A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device.",EAP
Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth.,EAP
"No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.",EAP
"I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments.",EAP
"It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances.",EAP
But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for.,EAP
"They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement.",EAP
The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered.,EAP
"I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne.",EAP
"The verses, which were entitled ""The Haunted Palace,"" ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus: I.",EAP
"In the greenest of our valleys, By good angels tenanted, Once fair and stately palace -- Radiant palace --reared its head.",EAP
In the monarch Thought's dominion -- It stood there!,EAP
Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair.,EAP
"Banners yellow, glorious, golden, On its roof did float and flow; (This --all this --was in the olden Time long ago) And every gentle air that dallied, In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, A winged odour went away.",EAP
"Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute's well-tuned law, Round about a throne, where sitting (Porphyrogene!)",EAP
"In state his glory well befitting, The ruler of the realm was seen.",EAP
"And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king.",EAP
"V. But evil things, in robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch's high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)",EAP
"And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed.",EAP
"And travellers now within that valley, Through the red-litten windows, see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody; While, like a rapid ghastly river, Through the pale door, A hideous throng rush out forever, And laugh --but smile no more.",EAP
"I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it.",EAP
"This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.",EAP
"But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization.",EAP
"I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion.",EAP
"The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers.",EAP
"The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones --in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around --above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.",EAP
"Its evidence --the evidence of the sentience --was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls.",EAP
"The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him --what he was.",EAP
"Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.",EAP
"Our books --the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid --were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm.",EAP
"We pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indagine, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella.",EAP
"One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and AEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours.",EAP
"His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic --the manual of a forgotten church --the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.",EAP
"I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building.",EAP
"The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute.",EAP
"The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family.",EAP
"I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.",EAP
"At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment.",EAP
"The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest.",EAP
"The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment.",EAP
"It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper.",EAP
"The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected.",EAP
"Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.",EAP
"Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant.",EAP
"A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them.",EAP
"Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead --for we could not regard her unawed.",EAP
"The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.",EAP
"We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.",EAP
"And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend.",EAP
His ordinary manner had vanished.,EAP
His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten.,EAP
"He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.",EAP
"The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue --but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out.",EAP
"The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance.",EAP
"There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage.",EAP
"At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.",EAP
It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me.,EAP
"I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.",EAP
"It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings.",EAP
Sleep came not near my couch --while the hours waned and waned away.,EAP
I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me.,EAP
"I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room --of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed.",EAP
But my efforts were fruitless.,EAP
"An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm.",EAP
"Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened --I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me --to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.",EAP
"Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.",EAP
"I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.",EAP
I presently recognised it as that of Usher.,EAP
"In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.",EAP
"His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan --but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes --an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.",EAP
"His air appalled me --but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.",EAP
"""And you have not seen it?""",EAP
"he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence --""you have not then seen it?",EAP
"Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.",EAP
The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.,EAP
"It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty.",EAP
"A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance.",EAP
I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this --yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars --nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning.,EAP
"But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.",EAP
"""You must not --you shall not behold this!""",EAP
"said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.",EAP
"""These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon --or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn.",EAP
Let us close this casement; --the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.,EAP
Here is one of your favourite romances.,EAP
"I will read, and you shall listen; --and so we will pass away this terrible night together.""",EAP
"The antique volume which I had taken up was the ""Mad Trist"" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.",EAP
"It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read.",EAP
"Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.",EAP
"I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force.",EAP
"Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus: ""And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.",EAP
"At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) --it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described.",EAP
"It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me.",EAP
"I continued the story: ""But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten -- Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin; Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.",EAP
"And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.""",EAP
"Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement --for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound --the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.",EAP
"Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion.",EAP
"I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour.",EAP
"From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.",EAP
"His head had dropped upon his breast --yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.",EAP
"The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea --for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.",EAP
"Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded: ""And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.""",EAP
"No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than --as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver, became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.",EAP
"Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed.",EAP
I rushed to the chair in which he sat.,EAP
"His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity.",EAP
"But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence.",EAP
"Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.",EAP
"--yes, I hear it, and have heard it.",EAP
"Long --long --long --many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it --yet I dared not --oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!",EAP
--I dared not --I dared not speak!,EAP
We have put her living in the tomb!,EAP
Said I not that my senses were acute?,EAP
I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.,EAP
"I heard them --many, many days ago --yet I dared not --I dared not speak!",EAP
And now --to-night --Ethelred --ha!,EAP
"--the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield!",EAP
"--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!",EAP
Oh whither shall I fly?,EAP
Will she not be here anon?,EAP
Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste?,EAP
Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?,EAP
Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?,EAP
"here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul --""MADMAN!",EAP
"I TELL YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR!""",EAP
"As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell --the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws.",EAP
It was the work of the rushing gust --but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.,EAP
"There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame.",EAP
"For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.",EAP
"From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.",EAP
The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway.,EAP
"Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.",EAP
"The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zig-zag direction, to the base.",EAP
"While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened --there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind --the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight --my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder --there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters --and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the ""HOUSE OF USHER.""",EAP
"IT was well said of a certain German book that ""er lasst sich nicht lesen"" --it does not permit itself to be read.",EAP
There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told.,EAP
"Men die nightly in their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors, and looking them piteously in the eyes --die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed.",EAP
"Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave.",EAP
And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.,EAP
"Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the large bow window of the D__ Coffee-House in London.",EAP
"For some months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui --moods of the keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs --the xxxxx xx xxxx xxxx [Greek text] --and the intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias.",EAP
Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain.,EAP
I felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing.,EAP
"With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.",EAP
"This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had been very much crowded during the whole day.",EAP
"But, as the darkness came on, the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door.",EAP
"At this particular period of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion.",EAP
"I gave up, at length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without.",EAP
At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn.,EAP
"I looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate relations.",EAP
"Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage, and expression of countenance.",EAP
"By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press.",EAP
"Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on.",EAP
"Others, still a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around.",EAP
"When impeded in their progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them.",EAP
"If jostled, they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.",EAP
--There was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I have noted.,EAP
Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent.,EAP
"They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers --the Eupatrids and the common-places of society --men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own --conducting business upon their own responsibility.",EAP
They did not greatly excite my attention.,EAP
The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable divisions.,EAP
"There were the junior clerks of flash houses --young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and supercilious lips.",EAP
"Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before.",EAP
"They wore the cast-off graces of the gentry; --and this, I believe, involves the best definition of the class.",EAP
"The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the ""steady old fellows,"" it was not possible to mistake.",EAP
"These were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or gaiters.",EAP
"--They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end.",EAP
"I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern.",EAP
Theirs was the affectation of respectability; --if indeed there be an affectation so honorable.,EAP
"There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets, with which all great cities are infested.",EAP
"I watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves.",EAP
"Their voluminousness of wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.",EAP
"The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily recognisable.",EAP
"They wore every variety of dress, from that of the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief, gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion.",EAP
"Still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip.",EAP
"There were two other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them; --a guarded lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.",EAP
"-- Very often, in company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather.",EAP
They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits.,EAP
They seem to prey upon the public in two battalions --that of the dandies and that of the military men.,EAP
Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles; of the second frogged coats and frowns.,EAP
"Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and deeper themes for speculation.",EAP
"I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided; women of the town of all kinds and of all ages --the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth --the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags --the wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at youth --the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable -- some in shreds and patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes -- some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces --others clothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well brushed --men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside these, pie-men, porters, coal- heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.",EAP
"As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief, as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre.",EAP
All was dark yet splendid --as that ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.,EAP
"The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of long years.",EAP
"With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob, when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,) --a countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression.",EAP
Any thing even remotely resembling that expression I had never seen before.,EAP
"I well remember that my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it, would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend.",EAP
"As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood-thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense --of supreme despair.",EAP
"I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated.",EAP
"""How wild a history,"" I said to myself, ""is written within that bosom!""",EAP
Then came a craving desire to keep the man in view --to know more of him.,EAP
"Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had seen him take; for he had already disappeared.",EAP
"With some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.",EAP
I had now a good opportunity of examining his person.,EAP
"He was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble.",EAP
"His clothes, generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger.",EAP
"These observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go.",EAP
"It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain.",EAP
"This change of weather had an odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas.",EAP
"The waver, the jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree.",EAP
For my own part I did not much regard the rain --the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant.,EAP
"Tying a handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on.",EAP
For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him.,EAP
"Never once turning his head to look back, he did not observe me.",EAP
"By and bye he passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted.",EAP
Here a change in his demeanor became evident.,EAP
He walked more slowly and with less object than before --more hesitatingly.,EAP
"He crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely.",EAP
"The street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the Park --so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that of the most frequented American city.",EAP
"A second turn brought us into a square, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life.",EAP
The old manner of the stranger re-appeared.,EAP
"His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who hemmed him in.",EAP
He urged his way steadily and perseveringly.,EAP
"I was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the square, that he turned and retraced his steps.",EAP
Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times --once nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement.,EAP
"In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first.",EAP
The rain fell fast; the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes.,EAP
"With a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a bye-street comparatively deserted.",EAP
"Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit.",EAP
"A few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and sellers.",EAP
"During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation.",EAP
"Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence.",EAP
At no moment did he see that I watched him.,EAP
"He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare.",EAP
"I was now utterly amazed at his behaviour, and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.",EAP
"A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the bazaar.",EAP
"A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame.",EAP
"He hurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started -- the street of the D__ Hotel.",EAP
"It no longer wore, however, the same aspect.",EAP
"It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen.",EAP
The stranger grew pale.,EAP
"He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the principal theatres.",EAP
"It was about being closed, and the audience were thronging from the doors.",EAP
"I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had, in some measure, abated.",EAP
His head again fell upon his breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first.,EAP
"I observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience --but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions.",EAP
"As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed.",EAP
"For some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented.",EAP
"The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed.",EAP
"It was the most noisome quarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime.",EAP
"By the dim light of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them.",EAP
"The paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.",EAP
Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters.,EAP
The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation.,EAP
"Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro.",EAP
"The spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death-hour.",EAP
Once more he strode onward with elastic tread.,EAP
"Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance --one of the palaces of the fiend, Gin.",EAP
It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance.,EAP
"With a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among the throng.",EAP
"He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night.",EAP
It was something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.,EAP
"Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London.",EAP
"Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing.",EAP
"The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D__ Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before.",EAP
"And here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the stranger.",EAP
"But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street.",EAP
"And, as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face.",EAP
"He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation.",EAP
"""This old man,"" I said at length, ""is the type and the genius of deep crime.",EAP
He refuses to be alone.,EAP
He is the man of the crowd.,EAP
"It will be in vain to follow; for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds.",EAP
"The worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the 'Hortulus Anim�,' * and perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that 'er lasst sich nicht lesen.'",EAP
"FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief.",EAP
"Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence.",EAP
"Yet, mad am I not -- and very surely do I not dream.",EAP
"But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul.",EAP
"My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events.",EAP
"In their consequences, these events have terrified -- have tortured -- have destroyed me.",EAP
Yet I will not attempt to expound them.,EAP
"To me, they have presented little but Horror -- to many they will seem less terrible than barroques.",EAP
"Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place -- some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.",EAP
From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition.,EAP
My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions.,EAP
"I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets.",EAP
"With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them.",EAP
"This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure.",EAP
"To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable.",EAP
"There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.",EAP
"I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own.",EAP
"Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind.",EAP
"We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.",EAP
"This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree.",EAP
"In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise.",EAP
"Not that she was ever serious upon this point -- and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.",EAP
Pluto -- this was the cat's name -- was my favorite pet and playmate.,EAP
"I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house.",EAP
It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets.,EAP
"Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character -- through the instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance -- had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse.",EAP
"I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others.",EAP
I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife.,EAP
"At length, I even offered her personal violence.",EAP
"My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition.",EAP
"I not only neglected, but ill-used them.",EAP
"For Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way.",EAP
But my disease grew upon me -- for what disease is like Alcohol !,EAP
"-- and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish -- even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.",EAP
"One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence.",EAP
"I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth.",EAP
The fury of a demon instantly possessed me.,EAP
I knew myself no longer.,EAP
"My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame.",EAP
"I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket !",EAP
"I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity.",EAP
"When reason returned with the morning -- when I had slept off the fumes of the night's debauch -- I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched.",EAP
"I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.",EAP
In the meantime the cat slowly recovered.,EAP
"The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain.",EAP
"He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach.",EAP
"I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me.",EAP
But this feeling soon gave place to irritation.,EAP
"And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS.",EAP
Of this spirit philosophy takes no account.,EAP
"Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart -- one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man.",EAP
"Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?",EAP
"Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such?",EAP
"This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow.",EAP
It was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself -- to offer violence to its own nature -- to do wrong for the wrong's sake only -- that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute.,EAP
"One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; -- hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; -- hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; -- hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin -- a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it -- if such a thing were possible -- even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.",EAP
"On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire.",EAP
The curtains of my bed were in flames.,EAP
The whole house was blazing.,EAP
"It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration.",EAP
The destruction was complete.,EAP
"My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.",EAP
"I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity.",EAP
But I am detailing a chain of facts -- and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.,EAP
"On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins.",EAP
"The walls, with one exception, had fallen in.",EAP
"This exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed.",EAP
"The plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the fire -- a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread.",EAP
"About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention.",EAP
"and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity.",EAP
"I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat.",EAP
The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous.,EAP
There was a rope about the animal's neck.,EAP
When I first beheld this apparition -- for I could scarcely regard it as less -- my wonder and my terror were extreme.,EAP
But at length reflection came to my aid.,EAP
"The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house.",EAP
"Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd -- by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my chamber.",EAP
This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep.,EAP
"The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had then accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.",EAP
"Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy.",EAP
"For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse.",EAP
"I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place.",EAP
"One night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy, my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment.",EAP
"I had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the object thereupon.",EAP
"I approached it, and touched it with my hand.",EAP
"It was a black cat -- a very large one -- fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one.",EAP
"Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast.",EAP
"Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice.",EAP
"This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search.",EAP
I at once offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to it -- knew nothing of it -- had never seen it before.,EAP
"I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me.",EAP
I permitted it to do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded.,EAP
"When it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great favorite with my wife.",EAP
"For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me.",EAP
This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but -- I know not how or why it was -- its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed.,EAP
"By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred.",EAP
"I avoided the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it.",EAP
"I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually -- very gradually -- I came to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.",EAP
"What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes.",EAP
"This circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.",EAP
"With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed to increase.",EAP
It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.,EAP
"Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses.",EAP
"If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast.",EAP
"At such times, although I longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly -- let me confess it at once -- by absolute dread of the beast.",EAP
This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil -- and yet I should be at a loss how otherwise to define it.,EAP
"I am almost ashamed to own -- yes, even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to own -- that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chim�ras it would be possible to conceive.",EAP
"My wife had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had destroyed.",EAP
"The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees -- degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject as fanciful -- it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline.",EAP
"It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to name -- and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared -- it was now, I say, the image of a hideous -- of a ghastly thing -- of the GALLOWS !",EAP
"-- oh, mournful and terrible engine of Horror and of Crime -- of Agony and of Death !",EAP
And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.,EAP
"And a brute beast -- whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed -- a brute beast to work out for me -- for me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God -- so much of insufferable wo!",EAP
neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more!,EAP
"During the former the creature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly, from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face, and its vast weight -- an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no power to shake off -- incumbent eternally upon my heart !",EAP
"Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed.",EAP
Evil thoughts became my sole intimates -- the darkest and most evil of thoughts.,EAP
"The moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas!",EAP
was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.,EAP
"One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit.",EAP
"The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness.",EAP
"Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished.",EAP
But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.,EAP
"Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.",EAP
"She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.",EAP
"This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body.",EAP
"I knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.",EAP
Many projects entered my mind.,EAP
"At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire.",EAP
"At another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar.",EAP
"Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the yard -- about packing it in a box, as if merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house.",EAP
Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than either of these.,EAP
I determined to wall it up in the cellar -- as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.,EAP
For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted.,EAP
"Its walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening.",EAP
"Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble the rest of the cellar.",EAP
"I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious.",EAP
And in this calculation I was not deceived.,EAP
"By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood.",EAP
"Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the new brick-work.",EAP
"When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right.",EAP
The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed.,EAP
The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care.,EAP
"I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself -- ""Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain.""",EAP
"My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death.",EAP
"Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood.",EAP
"It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom.",EAP
"It did not make its appearance during the night -- and thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul!",EAP
"The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.",EAP
Once again I breathed as a freeman.,EAP
"The monster, in terror, had fled the premises forever!",EAP
I should behold it no more!,EAP
My happiness was supreme!,EAP
The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little.,EAP
"Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered.",EAP
Even a search had been instituted -- but of course nothing was to be discovered.,EAP
I looked upon my future felicity as secured.,EAP
"Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises.",EAP
"Secure, however, in the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever.",EAP
The officers bade me accompany them in their search.,EAP
They left no nook or corner unexplored.,EAP
"At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar.",EAP
I quivered not in a muscle.,EAP
My heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence.,EAP
I walked the cellar from end to end.,EAP
"I folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro.",EAP
The police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart.,EAP
The glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained.,EAP
"I burned to say if but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.",EAP
"""Gentlemen,"" I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, ""I delight to have allayed your suspicions.",EAP
"I wish you all health, and a little more courtesy.",EAP
"By the bye, gentlemen, this -- this is a very well constructed house.""",EAP
"(In the rabid desire to say something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)",EAP
"-- ""I may say an excellently well constructed house.",EAP
"These walls -- are you going, gentlemen?",EAP
"-- these walls are solidly put together;"" and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.",EAP
But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend !,EAP
"No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb!",EAP
"-- by a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman -- a howl -- a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the dammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.",EAP
Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak.,EAP
"Swooning, I staggered to the opposite wall.",EAP
"For one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe.",EAP
"In the next, a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall.",EAP
"The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators.",EAP
"Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman.",EAP
I had walled the monster up within the tomb!,EAP
"Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion.",EAP
It would have been a miracle had it not -- especially under the circumstances.,EAP
"Through the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from the public, at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunities for investigation -- through our endeavors to effect this -- a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very naturally, of a great deal of disbelief.",EAP
It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts -- as far as I comprehend them myself.,EAP
"They are, succinctly, these: My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago, it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission: no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis.",EAP
"It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be arrested by the process.",EAP
"There were other points to be ascertained, but these most excited my curiosity -- the last in especial, from the immensely important character of its consequences.",EAP
"In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the ""Bibliotheca Forensica,"" and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of ""Wallenstein"" and ""Gargantua.""",EAP
"M. Valdemar, who has resided principally at Harlem, N. Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person -- his lower limbs much resembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair -- the latter, in consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig.",EAP
"His temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment.",EAP
"On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate.",EAP
"His will was at no period positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon.",EAP
I always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health.,EAP
"For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis.",EAP
"It was his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.",EAP
"When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar.",EAP
I knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him; and he had no relatives in America who would be likely to interfere.,EAP
"I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited.",EAP
"I say to my surprise; for, although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments, he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what I did.",EAP
His disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.,EAP
"It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M. Valdemar himself, the subjoined note: ""MY DEAR P___, You may as well come now.",EAP
D___ and F___ are agreed that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very nearly.,EAP
"I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber.",EAP
"I had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him.",EAP
"His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme, that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones.",EAP
His expectoration was excessive.,EAP
The pulse was barely perceptible.,EAP
"He retained, nevertheless, in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength.",EAP
"He spoke with distinctness -- took some palliative medicines without aid -- and, when I entered the room, was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book.",EAP
He was propped up in the bed by pillows.,EAP
Doctors D___ and F___ were in attendance.,EAP
"After pressing Valdemar's hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and obtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition.",EAP
"The left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of vitality.",EAP
"The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into another.",EAP
"Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place.",EAP
These appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date.,EAP
"The ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no sign of it had discovered a month before, and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.",EAP
"Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible.",EAP
It was the opinion of both physicians that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday.),EAP
It was then seven o'clock on Saturday evening.,EAP
"On quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself, Doctors D___ and F___ had bidden him a final farewell.",EAP
"It had not been their intention to return; but, at my request, they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.",EAP
"When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the experiment proposed.",EAP
"He still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once.",EAP
"A male and a female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove.",EAP
"I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when the arrival of a medical student, with whom I had some acquaintance, (Mr. Theodore L___l,) relieved me from farther embarrassment.",EAP
"It had been my design, originally, to wait for the physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.",EAP
"Mr. L___l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred; and it is from his memoranda that what I now have to relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.",EAP
"It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L___l, whether he (M. Valdemar,) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.",EAP
"He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, ""Yes, I wish to be mesmerized"" -- adding immediately afterwards, ""I fear you have deferred it too long.""",EAP
"While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found most effectual in subduing him.",EAP
"He was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I exerted all my powers, no farther perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o'clock, when Doctors D___ and F___ called, according to appointment.",EAP
"I explained to them, in a few words, what I designed, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was already in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation -- exchanging, however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.",EAP
"By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.",EAP
This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour.,EAP
"At the expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing ceased -- that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the intervals were undiminished.",EAP
The patient's extremities were of an icy coldness.,EAP
"At five minutes before eleven, I perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence.",EAP
"The glassy roll of the eye was changed for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake.",EAP
"With a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient sleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether.",EAP
"I was not satisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulations vigorously, and with the fullest exertion of the will, until I had completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer, after placing them in a seemingly easy position.",EAP
"The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loins.",EAP
The head was very slightly elevated.,EAP
"When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar's condition.",EAP
"After a few experiments, they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance.",EAP
The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited.,EAP
"Dr. D___ resolved at once to remain with the patient all night, while Dr. F___ took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.",EAP
Mr. L___l and the nurses remained.,EAP
"We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when Dr. F___ went away -- that is to say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the lips;) the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.",EAP
"Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of death.",EAP
"As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently to and fro above his person.",EAP
"In such experiments with this patient, I had never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine.",EAP
I determined to hazard a few words of conversation.,EAP
"""M. Valdemar,"" I said, ""are you asleep?""",EAP
"He made no answer, but I perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the question, again and again.",EAP
"At its third repetition, his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eye-lids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words: ""Yes; asleep now.",EAP
Do not wake me!,EAP
"-- let me die so!""",EAP
I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever.,EAP
"The right arm, as before, obeyed the direction of my hand.",EAP
"I questioned the sleep-waker again: ""Do you still feel pain in the breast, M.",EAP
"The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before: ""No pain -- I am dying.""",EAP
"I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F___, who came a little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive.",EAP
"After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again.",EAP
"I did so, saying: ""M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?""",EAP
"As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.",EAP
"At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost inaudibly: ""Yes; still asleep -- dying.""",EAP
"It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene -- and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes.",EAP
"I concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my previous question.",EAP
"While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep-waker.",EAP
"The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once.",EAP
"I use this expression, because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath.",EAP
"The upper lip, at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue.",EAP
"I presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.",EAP
I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will be startled into positive disbelief.,EAP
"It is my business, however, simply to proceed.",EAP
"There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.",EAP
This continued for perhaps a minute.,EAP
"At the expiration of this period, there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice -- such as it would be madness in me to attempt describing.",EAP
"There are, indeed, two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity.",EAP
"There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation -- as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity.",EAP
"In the first place, the voice seemed to reach our ears -- at least mine -- from a vast distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth.",EAP
"In the second place, it impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch.",EAP
"I have spoken both of ""sound"" and of ""voice.""",EAP
"I mean to say that the sound was one of distinct -- of even wonderfully, thrillingly distinct -- syllabification.",EAP
M. Valdemar spoke -- obviously in reply to the question I had propounded to him a few minutes before.,EAP
"I had asked him, it will be remembered, if he still slept.",EAP
"He now said: ""Yes; -- no; -- I have been sleeping -- and now -- now -- I am dead.",EAP
"No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were so well calculated to convey.",EAP
Mr. L___l (the student) swooned.,EAP
"The nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return.",EAP
My own impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader.,EAP
"For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently -- without the utterance of a word -- in endeavors to revive Mr. L___l.",EAP
"When he came to himself, we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar's condition.",EAP
"It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration.",EAP
An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed.,EAP
"I should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my will.",EAP
I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand.,EAP
"The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question.",EAP
"He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition.",EAP
To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible -- although I endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him.,EAP
I believe that I have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker's state at this epoch.,EAP
Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock I left the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L___l.,EAP
In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient.,EAP
His condition remained precisely the same.,EAP
We had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing.,EAP
"It was evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric process.",EAP
"It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy dissolution.",EAP
"From this period until the close of last week -- an interval of nearly seven months -- we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends.",EAP
All this time the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him.,EAP
The nurses' attentions were continual.,EAP
"It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles -- to so much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.",EAP
"For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I made use of the customary passes.",EAP
"These, for a time, were unsuccessful.",EAP
The first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris.,EAP
"It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.",EAP
"It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient's arm, as heretofore.",EAP
I made the attempt and failed.,EAP
Dr. F___ then intimated a desire to have me put a question.,EAP
"I did so, as follows: ""M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now?""",EAP
"There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length the same hideous voice which I have already described, broke forth: ""For God's sake!",EAP
"-- put me to sleep -- or, quick!",EAP
"-- I say to you that I am dead!""",EAP
"I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to do.",EAP
"At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him.",EAP
In this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful -- or at least I soon fancied that my success would be complete -- and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.,EAP
"For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared.",EAP
"As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of ""dead!",EAP
"absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once -- within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk -- crumbled -- absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.",EAP
"Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome -- of detestable putridity.",EAP
