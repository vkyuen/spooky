0,"Letter 1  _To Mrs. Saville, England._   St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.",MWS
1,You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.,MWS
2,"I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.",MWS
3,"I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.",MWS
4,Do you understand this feeling?,MWS
5,"This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.",MWS
6,"Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.",MWS
7,I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.,MWS
8,"There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.",MWS
9,"There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.",MWS
10,"Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.",MWS
11,What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?,MWS
12,I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.,MWS
13,"I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.",MWS
14,"These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.",MWS
15,"But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",MWS
16,"These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.",MWS
17,This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.,MWS
18,I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole.,MWS
19,You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library.,MWS
20,"My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.",MWS
21,"These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.",MWS
22,"These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.",MWS
23,I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.,MWS
24,You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.,MWS
25,"But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.",MWS
26,Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.,MWS
27,"I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.",MWS
28,I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.,MWS
29,"I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.",MWS
30,"Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.",MWS
31,"I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.",MWS
32,"And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?",MWS
33,"My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.",MWS
34,"Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!",MWS
35,"My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.",MWS
36,"I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.",MWS
37,This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.,MWS
38,"They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.",MWS
39,"The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.",MWS
40,I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.,MWS
41,"I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.",MWS
42,I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return?,MWS
43,"Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",MWS
44,"If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet.",MWS
45,"If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.",MWS
46,"Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret.",MWS
47,"Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.",MWS
48,"Your affectionate brother,  R. Walton       Letter 2     _To Mrs. Saville, England._   Archangel, 28th March, 17—.",MWS
49,"How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!",MWS
50,Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.,MWS
51,I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.,MWS
52,"But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.",MWS
53,"I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.",MWS
54,"I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to mine.",MWS
55,"You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend.",MWS
56,"I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans.",MWS
57,How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother!,MWS
58,I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.,MWS
59,But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.,MWS
60,At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.,MWS
61,Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.,MWS
62,"It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.",MWS
63,"Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.",MWS
64,"Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.",MWS
65,"My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession.",MWS
66,"He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.",MWS
67,"I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.",MWS
68,The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.,MWS
69,"This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him.",MWS
70,"A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.",MWS
71,"I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.",MWS
72,"This, briefly, is his story.",MWS
73,"Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.",MWS
74,"He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union.",MWS
75,"My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit.",MWS
76,"He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.",MWS
77,"But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.",MWS
78,“What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim.,MWS
79,"He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.",MWS
80,"Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions.",MWS
81,"Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.",MWS
82,"The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected.",MWS
83,I shall do nothing rashly:  you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.,MWS
84,I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.,MWS
85,"It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart.",MWS
86,"I am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.”  You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret.",MWS
87,"I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.",MWS
88,There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand.,MWS
89,"I am practically industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.",MWS
90,But to return to dearer considerations.,MWS
91,"Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?",MWS
92,"I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture.",MWS
93,Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits.,MWS
94,I love you very tenderly.,MWS
95,"Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.",MWS
96,"Your affectionate brother,   Robert Walton       Letter 3     _To Mrs. Saville, England._   July 7th, 17—.",MWS
97,"My dear Sister,  I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced on my voyage.",MWS
98,"This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years.",MWS
99,"I am, however, in good spirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.",MWS
100,"We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.",MWS
101,No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.,MWS
102,"One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.",MWS
103,"Adieu, my dear Margaret.",MWS
104,"Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.",MWS
105,"I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.",MWS
106,But success _shall_ crown my endeavours.,MWS
107,"Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.",MWS
108,Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?,MWS
109,What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?,MWS
110,My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.,MWS
111,But I must finish.,MWS
112,Heaven bless my beloved sister!,MWS
113,"Letter 4     _To Mrs. Saville, England._   August 5th, 17—.",MWS
114,"So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.",MWS
115,"Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated.",MWS
116,"Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog.",MWS
117,"We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.",MWS
118,"About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end.",MWS
119,"Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.",MWS
120,"We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.",MWS
121,We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.,MWS
122,This appearance excited our unqualified wonder.,MWS
123,"We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.",MWS
124,"Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.",MWS
125,"About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.",MWS
126,"We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.",MWS
127,I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.,MWS
128,"In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea.",MWS
129,"It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice.",MWS
130,Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.,MWS
131,"He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European.",MWS
132,"When I appeared on deck the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”  On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.",MWS
133,"“Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”  You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.",MWS
134,"I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.",MWS
135,Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.,MWS
136,"Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.",MWS
137,"His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.",MWS
138,I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.,MWS
139,"We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted.",MWS
140,We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.,MWS
141,As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.,MWS
142,"By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.",MWS
143,"Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.",MWS
144,"When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.",MWS
145,"I never saw a more interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.",MWS
146,"But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.",MWS
147,"When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.",MWS
148,"Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.",MWS
149,"His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”  “And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”  “Yes.”  “Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”  This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued.",MWS
150,"Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”  “Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”  “And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”  Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.",MWS
151,"I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.",MWS
152,From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.,MWS
153,"He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.",MWS
154,I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.,MWS
155,Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.,MWS
156,The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.,MWS
157,"Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him.",MWS
158,"For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.",MWS
159,"He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.",MWS
160,"I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.",MWS
161,"I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.",MWS
162,My affection for my guest increases every day.,MWS
163,He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.,MWS
164,How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?,MWS
165,"He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",MWS
166,"He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.",MWS
167,"Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.",MWS
168,"He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.",MWS
169,He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it.,MWS
170,"I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise.",MWS
171,"One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.",MWS
172,"As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance.",MWS
173,"At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.",MWS
174,"I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man!",MWS
175,Do you share my madness?,MWS
176,Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?,MWS
177,"Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”  Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.",MWS
178,"Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.",MWS
179,He asked me the history of my earlier years.,MWS
180,"The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection.",MWS
181,"I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.",MWS
182,"“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",MWS
183,"I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.",MWS
184,"You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair.",MWS
185,"But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.”  As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart.",MWS
186,But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.,MWS
187,"Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.",MWS
188,"The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.",MWS
189,"Such a man has a double existence:  he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",MWS
190,Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?,MWS
191,You would not if you saw him.,MWS
192,"You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.",MWS
193,Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.,MWS
194,"I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",MWS
195,"Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.",MWS
196,"I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination.",MWS
197,"You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.",MWS
198,"I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.",MWS
199,Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.,MWS
200,"Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”  You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.",MWS
201,"I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.",MWS
202,I expressed these feelings in my answer.,MWS
203,"“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.",MWS
204,"I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace.",MWS
205,"I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.”  He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure.",MWS
206,This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.,MWS
207,"I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day.",MWS
208,"If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes.",MWS
209,"This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day!",MWS
210,"Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.",MWS
211,"Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!",MWS
212,"Chapter 1  I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.",MWS
213,"My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.",MWS
214,He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.,MWS
215,"He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.",MWS
216,"As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them.",MWS
217,"One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.",MWS
218,"This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.",MWS
219,"Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.",MWS
220,My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.,MWS
221,He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.,MWS
222,"He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.",MWS
223,"Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.",MWS
224,"Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss.",MWS
225,"But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.",MWS
226,"Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house.",MWS
227,"The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.",MWS
228,"His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.",MWS
229,"But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.",MWS
230,She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.,MWS
231,Several months passed in this manner.,MWS
232,"Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar.",MWS
233,"This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber.",MWS
234,"He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.",MWS
235,Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.,MWS
236,"There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.",MWS
237,There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.,MWS
238,Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.,MWS
239,"There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.",MWS
240,Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.,MWS
241,"He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.",MWS
242,"Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.",MWS
243,"During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.",MWS
244,From Italy they visited Germany and France.,MWS
245,"I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.",MWS
246,I remained for several years their only child.,MWS
247,"Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.",MWS
248,My mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.,MWS
249,"I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.",MWS
250,"With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.",MWS
251,For a long time I was their only care.,MWS
252,"My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.",MWS
253,"When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.",MWS
254,Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.,MWS
255,"This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted.",MWS
256,"During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape.",MWS
257,"One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.",MWS
258,"She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.",MWS
259,Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.,MWS
260,She appeared of a different stock.,MWS
261,"The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.",MWS
262,"Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.",MWS
263,"Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",MWS
264,"The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.",MWS
265,"She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.",MWS
266,Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth.,MWS
267,The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then.,MWS
268,"They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born.",MWS
269,"The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.",MWS
270,He became the victim of its weakness.,MWS
271,Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.,MWS
272,His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.,MWS
273,"She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.",MWS
274,"When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills.",MWS
275,The apparition was soon explained.,MWS
276,With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.,MWS
277,They were fond of the sweet orphan.,MWS
278,"Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.",MWS
279,"They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.",MWS
280,"The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight.",MWS
281,"On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.”  And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish.",MWS
282,All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own.,MWS
283,We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin.,MWS
284,"No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.",MWS
285,Chapter 2  We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages.,MWS
286,I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.,MWS
287,"Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together.",MWS
288,"Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.",MWS
289,"She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.",MWS
290,"While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes.",MWS
291,The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.,MWS
292,"Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.",MWS
293,"On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country.",MWS
294,"We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.",MWS
295,"We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.",MWS
296,It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.,MWS
297,"I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.",MWS
298,Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.,MWS
299,He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.,MWS
300,"He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake.",MWS
301,He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.,MWS
302,He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.,MWS
303,"He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.",MWS
304,No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.,MWS
305,My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.,MWS
306,"We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.",MWS
307,"When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.",MWS
308,"My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately.",MWS
309,"I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.",MWS
310,"It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",MWS
311,"Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.",MWS
312,"The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.",MWS
313,The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.,MWS
314,"Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.",MWS
315,"She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.",MWS
316,And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?,MWS
317,"Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.",MWS
318,"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.",MWS
319,"Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.",MWS
320,"Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.",MWS
321,When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.,MWS
322,In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.,MWS
323,I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.,MWS
324,"A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father.",MWS
325,"My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, “Ah!",MWS
326,"My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.”  If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.",MWS
327,It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.,MWS
328,"But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.",MWS
329,"When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.",MWS
330,I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.,MWS
331,I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature.,MWS
332,"In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.",MWS
333,Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.,MWS
334,Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.,MWS
335,The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.,MWS
336,The most learned philosopher knew little more.,MWS
337,"He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.",MWS
338,"He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.",MWS
339,"I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.",MWS
340,"But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.",MWS
341,"I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.",MWS
342,"It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies.",MWS
343,"My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.",MWS
344,Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.,MWS
345,"Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!",MWS
346,Nor were these my only visions.,MWS
347,"The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.",MWS
348,"And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.",MWS
349,"When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.",MWS
350,"It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.",MWS
351,"I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.",MWS
352,"As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump.",MWS
353,"When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.",MWS
354,"It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.",MWS
355,I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.,MWS
356,Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.,MWS
357,"On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.",MWS
358,"All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.",MWS
359,It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known.,MWS
360,All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.,MWS
361,"By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.",MWS
362,"In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",MWS
363,"Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.",MWS
364,"When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.",MWS
365,Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.,MWS
366,"It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.",MWS
367,"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.",MWS
368,"Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.",MWS
369,Chapter 3  When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.,MWS
370,"I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.",MWS
371,"My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.",MWS
372,"Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.",MWS
373,During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.,MWS
374,"She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.",MWS
375,"She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.",MWS
376,"On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.",MWS
377,On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.,MWS
378,She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself.,MWS
379,"“My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.",MWS
380,This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.,MWS
381,"Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children.",MWS
382,"I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?",MWS
383,"But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”  She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.",MWS
384,"I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.",MWS
385,"It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard.",MWS
386,"These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.",MWS
387,Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?,MWS
388,"And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",MWS
389,"The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished.",MWS
390,"My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.",MWS
391,"My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon.",MWS
392,I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.,MWS
393,"It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life.",MWS
394,"I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.",MWS
395,"I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.",MWS
396,She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.,MWS
397,She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.,MWS
398,She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.,MWS
399,"Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.",MWS
400,She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.,MWS
401,The day of my departure at length arrived.,MWS
402,Clerval spent the last evening with us.,MWS
403,"He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.",MWS
404,His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.,MWS
405,Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.,MWS
406,"He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.",MWS
407,"We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!”  It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",MWS
408,I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections.,MWS
409,"I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—I was now alone.",MWS
410,In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.,MWS
411,"My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.",MWS
412,"I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.",MWS
413,"Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.",MWS
414,I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.,MWS
415,"I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.",MWS
416,"Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.",MWS
417,"I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.",MWS
418,At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.,MWS
419,I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.,MWS
420,The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.,MWS
421,"Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.",MWS
422,"He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.",MWS
423,He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.,MWS
424,"I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.",MWS
425,"“Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”  I replied in the affirmative.",MWS
426,"“Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.",MWS
427,You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.,MWS
428,"In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?",MWS
429,"I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.",MWS
430,"My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”  So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.",MWS
431,"I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.",MWS
432,"M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.",MWS
433,"In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years.",MWS
434,As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.,MWS
435,"With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.",MWS
436,"Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.",MWS
437,"It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed.",MWS
438,The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.,MWS
439,I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.,MWS
440,"Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.",MWS
441,"But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.",MWS
442,"And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",MWS
443,"Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.",MWS
444,This professor was very unlike his colleague.,MWS
445,"He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.",MWS
446,His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.,MWS
447,"He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.",MWS
448,He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.,MWS
449,"After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:  “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities and performed nothing.",MWS
450,"The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.",MWS
451,They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.,MWS
452,"They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.",MWS
453,"They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”  Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me.",MWS
454,"As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose.",MWS
455,"So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",MWS
456,I closed not my eyes that night.,MWS
457,"My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it.",MWS
458,"By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came.",MWS
459,"I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.",MWS
460,There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.,MWS
461,On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.,MWS
462,"His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.",MWS
463,I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.,MWS
464,"He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.",MWS
465,He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.,MWS
466,"They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.",MWS
467,"The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”  I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.",MWS
468,I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.,MWS
469,"“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.",MWS
470,"Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science.",MWS
471,A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.,MWS
472,"If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”  He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.",MWS
473,"He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.",MWS
474,Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.,MWS
475,"Chapter 4  From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.",MWS
476,"I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.",MWS
477,"I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.",MWS
478,In M. Waldman I found a true friend.,MWS
479,"His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.",MWS
480,In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.,MWS
481,My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.,MWS
482,"As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.",MWS
483,"My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters.",MWS
484,"Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.",MWS
485,"Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make.",MWS
486,None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.,MWS
487,"In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.",MWS
488,"A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.",MWS
489,"When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.",MWS
490,"One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.",MWS
491,"Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",MWS
492,"It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.",MWS
493,I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.,MWS
494,"Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.",MWS
495,"To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.",MWS
496,"I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.",MWS
497,In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.,MWS
498,I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.,MWS
499,"Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.",MWS
500,Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses.,MWS
501,My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.,MWS
502,I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.,MWS
503,"I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.",MWS
504,"Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.",MWS
505,The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.,MWS
506,"Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.",MWS
507,"After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.",MWS
508,The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.,MWS
509,"After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.",MWS
510,"But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.",MWS
511,What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.,MWS
512,"Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once:  the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.",MWS
513,"I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.",MWS
514,"I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.",MWS
515,"I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.",MWS
516,"Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.",MWS
517,"When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.",MWS
518,"Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.",MWS
519,"I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.",MWS
520,"The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed.",MWS
521,"I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.",MWS
522,Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.,MWS
523,It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.,MWS
524,"As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.",MWS
525,"After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.",MWS
526,"No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.",MWS
527,"Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.",MWS
528,A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.,MWS
529,No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.,MWS
530,"Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",MWS
531,"These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.",MWS
532,"My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement.",MWS
533,"Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise.",MWS
534,"One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.",MWS
535,Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?,MWS
536,"My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.",MWS
537,"It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.",MWS
538,"I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame.",MWS
539,"In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.",MWS
540,"The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.",MWS
541,"The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit.",MWS
542,"It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.",MWS
543,"And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time.",MWS
544,"I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father:  “I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.",MWS
545,"You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.”  I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.",MWS
546,"I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.",MWS
547,"I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.",MWS
548,A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.,MWS
549,I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.,MWS
550,"If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.",MWS
551,"If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.",MWS
552,"But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.",MWS
553,My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.,MWS
554,"Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.",MWS
555,"The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.",MWS
556,"But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.",MWS
557,"Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.",MWS
558,"Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.",MWS
559,Chapter 5  It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.,MWS
560,"With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.",MWS
561,"It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.",MWS
562,"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?",MWS
563,"His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.",MWS
564,"His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",MWS
565,The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.,MWS
566,"I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",MWS
567,For this I had deprived myself of rest and health.,MWS
568,"I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.",MWS
569,"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.",MWS
570,"At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.",MWS
571,"But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.",MWS
572,"I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.",MWS
573,"Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.",MWS
574,"I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created.",MWS
575,"He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.",MWS
576,"His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.",MWS
577,"He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.",MWS
578,"I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.",MWS
579,No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.,MWS
580,A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.,MWS
581,"I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.",MWS
582,I passed the night wretchedly.,MWS
583,"Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.",MWS
584,"Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",MWS
585,"Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.",MWS
586,"The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view.",MWS
587,"I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.",MWS
588,"I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.",MWS
589,I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.,MWS
590,"My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:      Like one who, on a lonely road,   Doth walk in fear and dread,   And, having once turned round, walks on,   And turns no more his head;   Because he knows a frightful fiend   Doth close behind him tread.",MWS
591,"[Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]    Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.",MWS
592,"Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.",MWS
593,"As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.",MWS
594,"“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you!",MWS
595,"How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!”  Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.",MWS
596,"I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy.",MWS
597,"I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college.",MWS
598,Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.,MWS
599,"“You may easily believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”  “It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”  “Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.",MWS
600,"By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.",MWS
601,"But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.”  “You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.”  I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.",MWS
602,"I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.",MWS
603,"I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.",MWS
604,"I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.",MWS
605,"Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room.",MWS
606,My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.,MWS
607,"I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me.",MWS
608,"I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.",MWS
609,"I stepped fearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.",MWS
610,"I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.",MWS
611,"We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself.",MWS
612,"It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly.",MWS
613,"I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.",MWS
614,"Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.",MWS
615,"“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter?",MWS
616,Do not laugh in that manner.,MWS
617,How ill you are!,MWS
618,"What is the cause of all this?”  “Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can tell.",MWS
619,Save me!”  I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.,MWS
620,What must have been his feelings?,MWS
621,"A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.",MWS
622,"But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.",MWS
623,This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.,MWS
624,During all that time Henry was my only nurse.,MWS
625,"I afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.",MWS
626,"He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.",MWS
627,"But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.",MWS
628,"The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.",MWS
629,"Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",MWS
630,"By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered.",MWS
631,"I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.",MWS
632,"It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.",MWS
633,"I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.",MWS
634,"“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me.",MWS
635,"This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.",MWS
636,How shall I ever repay you?,MWS
637,"I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”  “You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”  I trembled.",MWS
638,What could it be?,MWS
639,Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?,MWS
640,"“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.",MWS
641,"They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.”  “Is that all, my dear Henry?",MWS
642,"How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?”  “If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.”      Chapter 6  Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.",MWS
643,"It was from my own Elizabeth:  “My dearest Cousin,  “You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.",MWS
644,"You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions.",MWS
645,"For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.",MWS
646,"I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself!",MWS
647,"I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.",MWS
648,Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.,MWS
649,I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.,MWS
650,“Get well—and return to us.,MWS
651,"You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.",MWS
652,"Your father’s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.",MWS
653,How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!,MWS
654,He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.,MWS
655,"He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us.",MWS
656,"My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application.",MWS
657,"He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.",MWS
658,I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.,MWS
659,"“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us.",MWS
660,The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.,MWS
661,"My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.",MWS
662,"Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household.",MWS
663,Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?,MWS
664,"Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.",MWS
665,"Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.",MWS
666,"This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.  My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.",MWS
667,The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.,MWS
668,"Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral.",MWS
669,A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.,MWS
670,"Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.",MWS
671,"“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy.",MWS
672,"My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.",MWS
673,"This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.",MWS
674,"Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.",MWS
675,"She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.",MWS
676,"“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.",MWS
677,Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.,MWS
678,"“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.",MWS
679,The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.,MWS
680,She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.,MWS
681,"Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother.",MWS
682,"She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.",MWS
683,Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.,MWS
684,The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.,MWS
685,"She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.",MWS
686,"Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.",MWS
687,"She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.",MWS
688,Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.,MWS
689,"She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",MWS
690,"“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.",MWS
691,"I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.",MWS
692,"When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health.",MWS
693,"He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.",MWS
694,"“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.",MWS
695,"The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.",MWS
696,"Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.",MWS
697,"Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.",MWS
698,"But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.",MWS
699,"She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.",MWS
700,"“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.",MWS
701,"Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one word will be a blessing to us.",MWS
702,"Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful.",MWS
703,"my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!",MWS
704,"“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”    “Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.",MWS
705,In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.,MWS
706,One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university.,MWS
707,"In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.",MWS
708,"Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.",MWS
709,"When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.",MWS
710,"Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.",MWS
711,He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.,MWS
712,But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.,MWS
713,"M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.",MWS
714,"He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.",MWS
715,What could I do?,MWS
716,"He meant to please, and he tormented me.",MWS
717,"I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.",MWS
718,"I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.",MWS
719,"Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.",MWS
720,"I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.",MWS
721,"I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",MWS
722,"M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.",MWS
723,"“D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.",MWS
724,"Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.",MWS
725,"A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay, ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, “M.",MWS
726,Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.,MWS
727,"Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”  M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",MWS
728,Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.,MWS
729,"He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.",MWS
730,"Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.",MWS
731,"The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.",MWS
732,"Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.",MWS
733,"I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.",MWS
734,"I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours.",MWS
735,"Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.",MWS
736,"When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.",MWS
737,How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!,MWS
738,"Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.",MWS
739,I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.,MWS
740,"My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.",MWS
741,"The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.",MWS
742,"The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.",MWS
743,"I acceded with pleasure to this proposition:  I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",MWS
744,"We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend.",MWS
745,"Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.",MWS
746,"how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.",MWS
747,"A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.",MWS
748,"When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.",MWS
749,A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.,MWS
750,"The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.",MWS
751,"I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.",MWS
752,"Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.",MWS
753,"The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.",MWS
754,"At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.",MWS
755,"We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.",MWS
756,"My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.",MWS
757,"Chapter 7  On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—  “My dear Victor,  “You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.",MWS
758,"But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.",MWS
759,"What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",MWS
760,"And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?",MWS
761,Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son?,MWS
762,"I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.",MWS
763,"“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!",MWS
764,"Victor, he is murdered!",MWS
765,“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.,MWS
766,"“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais.",MWS
767,"The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.",MWS
768,"It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.",MWS
769,We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.,MWS
770,"Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.",MWS
771,"“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.",MWS
772,He was not there.,MWS
773,"We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.",MWS
774,"About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.",MWS
775,"“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.",MWS
776,She was very earnest to see the corpse.,MWS
777,"At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God!",MWS
778,"I have murdered my darling child!’  “She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.",MWS
779,"When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.",MWS
780,"She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.",MWS
781,"This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.",MWS
782,"We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!",MWS
783,"“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.",MWS
784,"She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.",MWS
785,"We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?",MWS
786,"I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",MWS
787,"“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds.",MWS
788,"Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.",MWS
789,"“Your affectionate and afflicted father,  “Alphonse Frankenstein.",MWS
790,"“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”    Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving new from my friends.",MWS
791,"I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.",MWS
792,"“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy?",MWS
793,"My dear friend, what has happened?”  I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation.",MWS
794,"Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.",MWS
795,"“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.",MWS
796,"What do you intend to do?”  “To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”  During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.",MWS
797,"“Poor William!” said he, “dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!",MWS
798,"Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss!",MWS
799,To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp!,MWS
800,How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!,MWS
801,"one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.",MWS
802,"The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.",MWS
803,"A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.",MWS
804,He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.”  Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude.,MWS
805,"But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.",MWS
806,My journey was very melancholy.,MWS
807,"At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.",MWS
808,I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.,MWS
809,"I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.",MWS
810,How altered every thing might be during that time!,MWS
811,"One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.",MWS
812,"Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.",MWS
813,"I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.",MWS
814,"I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed.",MWS
815,"By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.",MWS
816,"The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town.",MWS
817,"I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.",MWS
818,I wept like a child.,MWS
819,my own beautiful lake!,MWS
820,how do you welcome your wanderer?,MWS
821,Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.,MWS
822,"Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”  I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.",MWS
823,"My country, my beloved country!",MWS
824,"who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!",MWS
825,"Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.",MWS
826,"Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily.",MWS
827,"The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.",MWS
828,"I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",MWS
829,"It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.",MWS
830,"The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered.",MWS
831,"As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.",MWS
832,During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.,MWS
833,"The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.",MWS
834,"It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.",MWS
835,"I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.",MWS
836,"It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.",MWS
837,"The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.",MWS
838,"The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt.",MWS
839,"Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.",MWS
840,"While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.",MWS
841,"This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel!",MWS
842,"this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.",MWS
843,"A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life.",MWS
844,What did he there?,MWS
845,Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?,MWS
846,"No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.",MWS
847,"The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.",MWS
848,Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.,MWS
849,_He_ was the murderer!,MWS
850,I could not doubt it.,MWS
851,The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.,MWS
852,"I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.",MWS
853,"He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",MWS
854,"The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.",MWS
855,I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.,MWS
856,Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?,MWS
857,"I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?",MWS
858,"No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.",MWS
859,But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.,MWS
860,"I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.",MWS
861,Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.,MWS
862,"The gates were open, and I hastened to my father’s house.",MWS
863,"My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made.",MWS
864,But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.,MWS
865,"A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.",MWS
866,"I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.",MWS
867,"I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.",MWS
868,"Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.",MWS
869,And then of what use would be pursuit?,MWS
870,Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve?,MWS
871,"These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.",MWS
872,It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house.,MWS
873,"I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.",MWS
874,"Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.",MWS
875,Beloved and venerable parent!,MWS
876,He still remained to me.,MWS
877,"I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece.",MWS
878,"It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.",MWS
879,"Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.",MWS
880,Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.,MWS
881,"While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he.",MWS
882,"I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.",MWS
883,"You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William!",MWS
884,"he was our darling and our pride!”  Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.",MWS
885,"Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster.",MWS
886,"I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.",MWS
887,"“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched.",MWS
888,But since the murderer has been discovered—”  “The murderer discovered!,MWS
889,how can that be?,MWS
890,who could attempt to pursue him?,MWS
891,"It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.",MWS
892,"I saw him too; he was free last night!”  “I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.",MWS
893,"No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.",MWS
894,"Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”  “Justine Moritz!",MWS
895,"Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?",MWS
896,"But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”  “No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.",MWS
897,"But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.”  He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days.",MWS
898,"During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.",MWS
899,"The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.",MWS
900,"On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.",MWS
901,"This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.",MWS
902,"Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”  At that instant my father entered.",MWS
903,"I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa!",MWS
904,"Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”  “We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”  “My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”  “If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.",MWS
905,"She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”  This speech calmed me.",MWS
906,"I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.",MWS
907,"I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her.",MWS
908,My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar.,MWS
909,"Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?",MWS
910,We were soon joined by Elizabeth.,MWS
911,Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.,MWS
912,"There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.",MWS
913,She welcomed me with the greatest affection.,MWS
914,"“Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope.",MWS
915,You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.,MWS
916,"who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",MWS
917,I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.,MWS
918,"Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.",MWS
919,"If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more.",MWS
920,"But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.”  “She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.”  “How kind and generous you are!",MWS
921,"every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.”  She wept.",MWS
922,"“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears.",MWS
923,"If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.”      Chapter 8  We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to commence.",MWS
924,"My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.",MWS
925,During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.,MWS
926,"It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.",MWS
927,"Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause!",MWS
928,"A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.",MWS
929,The appearance of Justine was calm.,MWS
930,"She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.",MWS
931,"Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.",MWS
932,"She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.",MWS
933,When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.,MWS
934,"A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.",MWS
935,"The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called.",MWS
936,"Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had.",MWS
937,She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.,MWS
938,"The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.",MWS
939,"She returned to the house about eight o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.",MWS
940,"When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.",MWS
941,"The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",MWS
942,Justine was called on for her defence.,MWS
943,"As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered.",MWS
944,"Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.",MWS
945,"Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.",MWS
946,"“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent.",MWS
947,"But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.”  She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.",MWS
948,"On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.",MWS
949,"She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.",MWS
950,"Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.",MWS
951,"It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother.",MWS
952,"If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.",MWS
953,"That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.",MWS
954,Concerning the picture she could give no account.,MWS
955,"“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.",MWS
956,But here also I am checked.,MWS
957,"I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.",MWS
958,Did the murderer place it there?,MWS
959,"I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?",MWS
960,"“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope.",MWS
961,"I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.”  Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.",MWS
962,"Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.",MWS
963,"“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.",MWS
964,"It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character.",MWS
965,I am well acquainted with the accused.,MWS
966,"I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.",MWS
967,During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.,MWS
968,"She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family.",MWS
969,She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.,MWS
970,"For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence.",MWS
971,"She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.”  A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.",MWS
972,"She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.",MWS
973,My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.,MWS
974,I believed in her innocence; I knew it.,MWS
975,Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?,MWS
976,"I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.",MWS
977,"The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.",MWS
978,I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.,MWS
979,In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched.,MWS
980,"I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.",MWS
981,"The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.",MWS
982,I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.,MWS
983,"I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.",MWS
984,The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.,MWS
985,"“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.”  This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?",MWS
986,Had my eyes deceived me?,MWS
987,And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?,MWS
988,"I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.",MWS
989,"“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.",MWS
990,"But she has confessed.”  This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s innocence.",MWS
991,“How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?,MWS
992,"Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?",MWS
993,"Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.”  Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.",MWS
994,My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.,MWS
995,"“Yes,” said Elizabeth, “I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.",MWS
996,"We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees.",MWS
997,"She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.",MWS
998,My cousin wept also.,MWS
999,"“Oh, Justine!” said she.",MWS
1000,“Why did you rob me of my last consolation?,MWS
1001,"I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.”  “And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?",MWS
1002,"Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her voice was suffocated with sobs.",MWS
1003,"“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel, if you are innocent?",MWS
1004,"I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.",MWS
1005,"That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.”  “I did confess, but I confessed a lie.",MWS
1006,"I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.",MWS
1007,The God of heaven forgive me!,MWS
1008,"Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was.",MWS
1009,He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate.,MWS
1010,"Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.",MWS
1011,What could I do?,MWS
1012,"In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.”  She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.",MWS
1013,"I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.”  “Oh, Justine!",MWS
1014,Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.,MWS
1015,Why did you confess?,MWS
1016,"But do not mourn, dear girl.",MWS
1017,"I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.",MWS
1018,I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.,MWS
1019,You shall not die!,MWS
1020,"You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!",MWS
1021,I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”  Justine shook her head mournfully.,MWS
1022,"“I do not fear to die,” she said; “that pang is past.",MWS
1023,God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.,MWS
1024,"I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me.",MWS
1025,"Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven!”  During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.",MWS
1026,Who dared talk of that?,MWS
1027,"The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony.",MWS
1028,"I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.",MWS
1029,"When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”  I could not answer.",MWS
1030,"“No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.”  “I truly thank him.",MWS
1031,In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.,MWS
1032,How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!,MWS
1033,"It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”  Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.",MWS
1034,She indeed gained the resignation she desired.,MWS
1035,"But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.",MWS
1036,"Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.",MWS
1037,Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.,MWS
1038,"We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away.",MWS
1039,"“I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.”  Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.",MWS
1040,"She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer!",MWS
1041,"Live, and be happy, and make others so.”  And on the morrow Justine died.",MWS
1042,Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.,MWS
1043,My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.,MWS
1044,"And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips.",MWS
1045,"Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.",MWS
1046,She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!,MWS
1047,"From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.",MWS
1048,This also was my doing!,MWS
1049,"And my father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands!",MWS
1050,"Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears!",MWS
1051,"Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!",MWS
1052,"Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!",MWS
1053,"Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.",MWS
1054,"Chapter 9  Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.",MWS
1055,"Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.",MWS
1056,"The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.",MWS
1057,"Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind.",MWS
1058,Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.,MWS
1059,I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.,MWS
1060,"Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.",MWS
1061,"This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.",MWS
1062,"I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",MWS
1063,My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.,MWS
1064,"“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer also?",MWS
1065,No one could love a child more than I loved your brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?,MWS
1066,"It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.”  This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations.",MWS
1067,Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.,MWS
1068,About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.,MWS
1069,This change was particularly agreeable to me.,MWS
1070,The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me.,MWS
1071,I was now free.,MWS
1072,"Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.",MWS
1073,"Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.",MWS
1074,"I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.",MWS
1075,"But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.",MWS
1076,I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?,MWS
1077,At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.,MWS
1078,But that could not be.,MWS
1079,Remorse extinguished every hope.,MWS
1080,"I had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.",MWS
1081,"I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.",MWS
1082,There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind.,MWS
1083,My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.,MWS
1084,"When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.",MWS
1085,"When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.",MWS
1086,"I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base.",MWS
1087,"I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.",MWS
1088,Our house was the house of mourning.,MWS
1089,My father’s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.,MWS
1090,Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.,MWS
1091,She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.,MWS
1092,"The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.",MWS
1093,"“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.",MWS
1094,"Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood.",MWS
1095,Yet I am certainly unjust.,MWS
1096,"Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.",MWS
1097,"For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own!",MWS
1098,"I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men.",MWS
1099,But she was innocent.,MWS
1100,"I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.",MWS
1101,"Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?",MWS
1102,"I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.",MWS
1103,"William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.",MWS
1104,"But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.”  I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.",MWS
1105,"I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.",MWS
1106,"Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you must calm yourself.",MWS
1107,"These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.",MWS
1108,"There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble.",MWS
1109,"Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.",MWS
1110,"Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.",MWS
1111,Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?,MWS
1112,"While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace?”  And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?",MWS
1113,"Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.",MWS
1114,"Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual.",MWS
1115,I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.,MWS
1116,"The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.",MWS
1117,"Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations.",MWS
1118,"It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.",MWS
1119,My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix.,MWS
1120,I had visited it frequently during my boyhood.,MWS
1121,"Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.",MWS
1122,I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.,MWS
1123,"I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads.",MWS
1124,"The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.",MWS
1125,The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve.,MWS
1126,"The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise.",MWS
1127,"Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.",MWS
1128,"Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.",MWS
1129,"But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.",MWS
1130,"I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.",MWS
1131,"Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.",MWS
1132,"This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.",MWS
1133,"The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.",MWS
1134,Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.,MWS
1135,"Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.",MWS
1136,A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey.,MWS
1137,"Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.",MWS
1138,"The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.",MWS
1139,Then again the kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.,MWS
1140,"Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.",MWS
1141,At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.,MWS
1142,Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.,MWS
1143,"For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.",MWS
1144,"The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.",MWS
1145,Chapter 10  I spent the following day roaming through the valley.,MWS
1146,"I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.",MWS
1147,"The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands.",MWS
1148,These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.,MWS
1149,"They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it.",MWS
1150,"In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month.",MWS
1151,"I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day.",MWS
1152,"They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.",MWS
1153,Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?,MWS
1154,"All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought.",MWS
1155,"The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends.",MWS
1156,Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats.,MWS
1157,What were rain and storm to me?,MWS
1158,"My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert.",MWS
1159,I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.,MWS
1160,It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.,MWS
1161,The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life.,MWS
1162,"I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.",MWS
1163,"The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.",MWS
1164,It is a scene terrifically desolate.,MWS
1165,"In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees.",MWS
1166,"The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.",MWS
1167,"The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.",MWS
1168,"I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me.",MWS
1169,Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.,MWS
1170,"If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.",MWS
1171,We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.,MWS
1172,We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.,MWS
1173,"We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,        Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;   It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,        The path of its departure still is free.",MWS
1174,Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;        Nought may endure but mutability!,MWS
1175,It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.,MWS
1176,For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.,MWS
1177,A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.,MWS
1178,"Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.",MWS
1179,"The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.",MWS
1180,"The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.",MWS
1181,The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.,MWS
1182,"From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.",MWS
1183,"I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.",MWS
1184,"The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.",MWS
1185,Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.,MWS
1186,"My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, “Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.”  As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed.",MWS
1187,"He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.",MWS
1188,"I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.",MWS
1189,"I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)",MWS
1190,that it was the wretch whom I had created.,MWS
1191,"I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat.",MWS
1192,"He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.",MWS
1193,"But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.",MWS
1194,"“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me?",MWS
1195,And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?,MWS
1196,"Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!",MWS
1197,"That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”  “I expected this reception,” said the dæmon.",MWS
1198,"“All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!",MWS
1199,"Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.",MWS
1200,You purpose to kill me.,MWS
1201,How dare you sport thus with life?,MWS
1202,"Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.",MWS
1203,"If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”  “Abhorred monster!",MWS
1204,Fiend that thou art!,MWS
1205,The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes.,MWS
1206,"You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.”  My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.",MWS
1207,"He easily eluded me and said,  “Be calm!",MWS
1208,I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.,MWS
1209,"Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?",MWS
1210,"Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.",MWS
1211,"Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple.",MWS
1212,But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.,MWS
1213,"I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me.",MWS
1214,"Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due.",MWS
1215,"Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.",MWS
1216,"Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded.",MWS
1217,I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.,MWS
1218,"Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”  “Begone!",MWS
1219,I will not hear you.,MWS
1220,There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies.,MWS
1221,"Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.”  “How can I move thee?",MWS
1222,"Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?",MWS
1223,"Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?",MWS
1224,"You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?",MWS
1225,They spurn and hate me.,MWS
1226,The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.,MWS
1227,"I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge.",MWS
1228,"These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings.",MWS
1229,"If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction.",MWS
1230,Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?,MWS
1231,I will keep no terms with my enemies.,MWS
1232,"I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness.",MWS
1233,"Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.",MWS
1234,"Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me.",MWS
1235,"Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.",MWS
1236,"The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.",MWS
1237,"Listen to me, Frankenstein.",MWS
1238,"You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.",MWS
1239,"Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!",MWS
1240,"Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”  “Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?",MWS
1241,"Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light!",MWS
1242,Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!,MWS
1243,You have made me wretched beyond expression.,MWS
1244,You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not.,MWS
1245,"Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.”  “Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.",MWS
1246,Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.,MWS
1247,"By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you.",MWS
1248,"Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain.",MWS
1249,"The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide.",MWS
1250,"On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.”  As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.",MWS
1251,"My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale.",MWS
1252,"I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution.",MWS
1253,"I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.",MWS
1254,"For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness.",MWS
1255,These motives urged me to comply with his demand.,MWS
1256,"We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.",MWS
1257,"The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.",MWS
1258,"But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.",MWS
1259,Chapter 11  “It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.,MWS
1260,"A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.",MWS
1261,"By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.",MWS
1262,"Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again.",MWS
1263,"I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.",MWS
1264,"Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.",MWS
1265,"The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.",MWS
1266,"This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.",MWS
1267,"This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.",MWS
1268,"I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",MWS
1269,"“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.",MWS
1270,"Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night.",MWS
1271,"I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.",MWS
1272,“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.,MWS
1273,I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.,MWS
1274,[The moon]  I gazed with a kind of wonder.,MWS
1275,"It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.",MWS
1276,"I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.",MWS
1277,No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.,MWS
1278,"I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.",MWS
1279,"“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.",MWS
1280,I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.,MWS
1281,"I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.",MWS
1282,"I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.",MWS
1283,Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.,MWS
1284,"Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.",MWS
1285,"“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.",MWS
1286,"My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.",MWS
1287,"My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.",MWS
1288,"I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.",MWS
1289,"“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it.",MWS
1290,"In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.",MWS
1291,"How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!",MWS
1292,"I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.",MWS
1293,"I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn.",MWS
1294,I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.,MWS
1295,The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.,MWS
1296,"I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.",MWS
1297,"When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.",MWS
1298,"I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.",MWS
1299,"“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.",MWS
1300,"I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.",MWS
1301,"I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.",MWS
1302,"When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.",MWS
1303,"I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers.",MWS
1304,"I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.",MWS
1305,"“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.",MWS
1306,"When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied.",MWS
1307,In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.,MWS
1308,"I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun.",MWS
1309,I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.,MWS
1310,"A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.",MWS
1311,"“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.",MWS
1312,"This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity.",MWS
1313,"Finding the door open, I entered.",MWS
1314,"An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.",MWS
1315,"He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.",MWS
1316,"His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.",MWS
1317,But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.,MWS
1318,"I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.",MWS
1319,"Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",MWS
1320,"“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village.",MWS
1321,How miraculous did this appear!,MWS
1322,"The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.",MWS
1323,"The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.",MWS
1324,"One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.",MWS
1325,"The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village.",MWS
1326,"This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it.",MWS
1327,"My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.",MWS
1328,"No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",MWS
1329,"“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.",MWS
1330,"As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.",MWS
1331,It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.,MWS
1332,"One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.",MWS
1333,"“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.",MWS
1334,"I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.",MWS
1335,"The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.",MWS
1336,"“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.",MWS
1337,"It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.",MWS
1338,"I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.",MWS
1339,"The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.",MWS
1340,"Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad.",MWS
1341,"I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.",MWS
1342,"As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.",MWS
1343,"Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.",MWS
1344,"She followed, and they disappeared.",MWS
1345,"Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.",MWS
1346,"“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood.",MWS
1347,In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.,MWS
1348,"Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.",MWS
1349,"In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.",MWS
1350,"The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.",MWS
1351,"It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.",MWS
1352,"The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.",MWS
1353,"He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.",MWS
1354,"He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.",MWS
1355,"“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.",MWS
1356,"The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.",MWS
1357,"She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire.",MWS
1358,"She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.",MWS
1359,"After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.",MWS
1360,"“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.",MWS
1361,The meal was quickly dispatched.,MWS
1362,"The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.",MWS
1363,Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.,MWS
1364,"One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.",MWS
1365,"The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.",MWS
1366,"“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.",MWS
1367,In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.,MWS
1368,"So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.",MWS
1369,"“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”      Chapter 12  “I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.",MWS
1370,I thought of the occurrences of the day.,MWS
1371,"What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.",MWS
1372,"I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.",MWS
1373,“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.,MWS
1374,"The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.",MWS
1375,“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.,MWS
1376,"The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.",MWS
1377,"The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.",MWS
1378,Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.,MWS
1379,"They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",MWS
1380,“They were not entirely happy.,MWS
1381,The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.,MWS
1382,"I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it.",MWS
1383,"If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched.",MWS
1384,Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?,MWS
1385,"They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness.",MWS
1386,What did their tears imply?,MWS
1387,Did they really express pain?,MWS
1388,"I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.",MWS
1389,"“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family:  it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.",MWS
1390,"Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.",MWS
1391,"They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.",MWS
1392,“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.,MWS
1393,"I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.",MWS
1394,“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.,MWS
1395,"I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.",MWS
1396,"“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside.",MWS
1397,"She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.",MWS
1398,"I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.",MWS
1399,“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.,MWS
1400,I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.,MWS
1401,"I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.",MWS
1402,"This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.",MWS
1403,But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.,MWS
1404,"Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.",MWS
1405,"By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and _wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.",MWS
1406,"The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or _Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_.",MWS
1407,I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.,MWS
1408,"I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good, dearest, unhappy._  “I spent the winter in this manner.",MWS
1409,"The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.",MWS
1410,"I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.",MWS
1411,"The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy.",MWS
1412,"He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.",MWS
1413,"Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.",MWS
1414,It was not thus with Felix.,MWS
1415,"He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.",MWS
1416,"But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.",MWS
1417,"“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.",MWS
1418,"In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.",MWS
1419,"Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.",MWS
1420,"In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him.",MWS
1421,"At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.",MWS
1422,"“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.",MWS
1423,"I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs?",MWS
1424,"I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",MWS
1425,"“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool!",MWS
1426,"At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.",MWS
1427,I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.,MWS
1428,"“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.",MWS
1429,"From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.",MWS
1430,"Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.",MWS
1431,"Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.",MWS
1432,"“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.",MWS
1433,"This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",MWS
1434,“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.,MWS
1435,"During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.",MWS
1436,"When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.",MWS
1437,"When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix.",MWS
1438,"I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.",MWS
1439,"“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.",MWS
1440,I thought (foolish wretch!),MWS
1441,that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.,MWS
1442,"When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me.",MWS
1443,I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.,MWS
1444,"I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.",MWS
1445,"I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.",MWS
1446,“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.,MWS
1447,"My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.",MWS
1448,"It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.",MWS
1449,“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.,MWS
1450,Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.,MWS
1451,"The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees.",MWS
1452,"Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.",MWS
1453,"My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”      Chapter 13  “I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.",MWS
1454,"I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.",MWS
1455,“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless.,MWS
1456,It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.,MWS
1457,My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.,MWS
1458,"“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow.",MWS
1459,"Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.",MWS
1460,"“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.",MWS
1461,The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil.,MWS
1462,"Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.",MWS
1463,Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.,MWS
1464,"On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.",MWS
1465,"Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.",MWS
1466,"“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger.",MWS
1467,"She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.",MWS
1468,"She did not appear to understand him, but smiled.",MWS
1469,"He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.",MWS
1470,"Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.",MWS
1471,"“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers.",MWS
1472,"They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.",MWS
1473,Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.,MWS
1474,"Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.",MWS
1475,"Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.",MWS
1476,"Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.",MWS
1477,"The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.",MWS
1478,"“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.",MWS
1479,"When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night sweet Safie.’  He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.",MWS
1480,"I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.",MWS
1481,"“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.",MWS
1482,"She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.",MWS
1483,"“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it.",MWS
1484,"She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.",MWS
1485,"The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.",MWS
1486,"“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.",MWS
1487,"Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.",MWS
1488,"“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.",MWS
1489,"“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.",MWS
1490,"“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.",MWS
1491,“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins of Empires_.,MWS
1492,"I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.",MWS
1493,"He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors.",MWS
1494,"Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.",MWS
1495,"I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.",MWS
1496,I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.,MWS
1497,“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.,MWS
1498,"Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?",MWS
1499,He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.,MWS
1500,"To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.",MWS
1501,"For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.",MWS
1502,“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.,MWS
1503,"While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.",MWS
1504,"I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.",MWS
1505,“The words induced me to turn towards myself.,MWS
1506,I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches.,MWS
1507,"A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!",MWS
1508,And what was I?,MWS
1509,"Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.",MWS
1510,"I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man.",MWS
1511,I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.,MWS
1512,When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me.,MWS
1513,"Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",MWS
1514,"“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.",MWS
1515,"Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!",MWS
1516,“Of what a strange nature is knowledge!,MWS
1517,It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.,MWS
1518,"I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand.",MWS
1519,"I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows.",MWS
1520,The gentle words of Agatha and  the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.,MWS
1521,The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.,MWS
1522,“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.,MWS
1523,"I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.",MWS
1524,“But where were my friends and relations?,MWS
1525,"No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing.",MWS
1526,From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.,MWS
1527,I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.,MWS
1528,"The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.",MWS
1529,"“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”      Chapter 14  “Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.",MWS
1530,"It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.",MWS
1531,“The name of the old man was De Lacey.,MWS
1532,"He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.",MWS
1533,"His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction.",MWS
1534,"A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.",MWS
1535,“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.,MWS
1536,"He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.",MWS
1537,He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him.,MWS
1538,He was tried and condemned to death.,MWS
1539,The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.,MWS
1540,“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court.,MWS
1541,"He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means.",MWS
1542,"After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.",MWS
1543,Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.,MWS
1544,"The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.",MWS
1545,"Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.",MWS
1546,“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.,MWS
1547,"Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.",MWS
1548,"“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French.",MWS
1549,"She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",MWS
1550,"“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.",MWS
1551,"Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.",MWS
1552,"“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her.",MWS
1553,"The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced.",MWS
1554,She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.,MWS
1555,"This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue.",MWS
1556,The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.,MWS
1557,"“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris.",MWS
1558,"Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself.",MWS
1559,"He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.",MWS
1560,"“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.",MWS
1561,"“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection.",MWS
1562,"They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.",MWS
1563,"“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans.",MWS
1564,"He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited.",MWS
1565,"He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.",MWS
1566,His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.,MWS
1567,“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.,MWS
1568,"The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison.",MWS
1569,The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.,MWS
1570,His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved.,MWS
1571,This idea was torture to him.,MWS
1572,"He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.",MWS
1573,“He did not succeed.,MWS
1574,"They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.",MWS
1575,"“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.",MWS
1576,"Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.",MWS
1577,"“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.",MWS
1578,"He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.",MWS
1579,The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.,MWS
1580,"“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.",MWS
1581,"The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.",MWS
1582,"“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.",MWS
1583,"He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.",MWS
1584,"“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency.",MWS
1585,A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it.,MWS
1586,By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided.,MWS
1587,"She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination.",MWS
1588,"Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.",MWS
1589,"“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.  Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.",MWS
1590,"She fell, however, into good hands.",MWS
1591,"The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.”      Chapter 15  “Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.",MWS
1592,It impressed me deeply.,MWS
1593,"I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.",MWS
1594,"“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed.",MWS
1595,"But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.",MWS
1596,"“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books.",MWS
1597,I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.,MWS
1598,"Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_.",MWS
1599,"The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.",MWS
1600,“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.,MWS
1601,"They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.",MWS
1602,"In the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.",MWS
1603,"The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom.",MWS
1604,"But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep.",MWS
1605,The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder.,MWS
1606,"I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.",MWS
1607,"“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition.",MWS
1608,I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener.,MWS
1609,"I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.",MWS
1610,"‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my annihilation.",MWS
1611,My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.,MWS
1612,What did this mean?,MWS
1613,Whence did I come?,MWS
1614,What was my destination?,MWS
1615,"These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.",MWS
1616,“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.,MWS
1617,This book had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.,MWS
1618,"I learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.",MWS
1619,Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.,MWS
1620,"I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas.",MWS
1621,But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men.,MWS
1622,"The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action.",MWS
1623,"I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.",MWS
1624,"I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.",MWS
1625,"Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.",MWS
1626,"The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.",MWS
1627,“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions.,MWS
1628,"I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history.",MWS
1629,It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.,MWS
1630,"I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own.",MWS
1631,"Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect.",MWS
1632,"He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.",MWS
1633,"Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.",MWS
1634,“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.,MWS
1635,Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.,MWS
1636,"At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.",MWS
1637,It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.,MWS
1638,You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.,MWS
1639,You doubtless recollect these papers.,MWS
1640,"Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible.",MWS
1641,I sickened as I read.,MWS
1642,‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony.,MWS
1643,Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in disgust?,MWS
1644,"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.",MWS
1645,"Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’  “These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.",MWS
1646,"Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?",MWS
1647,"I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.",MWS
1648,"I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.",MWS
1649,"Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.",MWS
1650,"“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.",MWS
1651,"The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.",MWS
1652,"Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants.",MWS
1653,"They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous.",MWS
1654,Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.,MWS
1655,"I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.",MWS
1656,"“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation.",MWS
1657,But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.,MWS
1658,I remembered Adam’s supplication to his Creator.,MWS
1659,But where was mine?,MWS
1660,"He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.",MWS
1661,"I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.",MWS
1662,Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.,MWS
1663,"But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers.",MWS
1664,Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.,MWS
1665,"They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them.",MWS
1666,"The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition.",MWS
1667,I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.,MWS
1668,The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away.,MWS
1669,"I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest:  I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.",MWS
1670,"“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life.",MWS
1671,My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.,MWS
1672,"I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.",MWS
1673,I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me.,MWS
1674,"My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.",MWS
1675,"“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage.",MWS
1676,"When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.",MWS
1677,"At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",MWS
1678,"“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realise my fears.",MWS
1679,The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair.,MWS
1680,"All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.",MWS
1681,"Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.",MWS
1682,"The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage.",MWS
1683,‘Who is there?’ said the old man.,MWS
1684,‘Come in.’  “I entered.,MWS
1685,"‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’  “‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.’  “‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.’  “I sat down, and a silence ensued.",MWS
1686,"I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.",MWS
1687,"‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?’  “‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only.",MWS
1688,"I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’  “‘Are they Germans?’  “‘No, they are French.",MWS
1689,But let us change the subject.,MWS
1690,"I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth.",MWS
1691,These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me.,MWS
1692,"I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’  “‘Do not despair.",MWS
1693,"To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity.",MWS
1694,"Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’  “‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.",MWS
1695,"I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.’  “‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?’  “‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors.",MWS
1696,"I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’  “‘Where do these friends reside?’  “‘Near this spot.’  “The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them.",MWS
1697,"I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere.",MWS
1698,"I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’  “‘Excellent man!",MWS
1699,I thank you and accept your generous offer.,MWS
1700,"You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.’  “‘Heaven forbid!",MWS
1701,"Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.",MWS
1702,"I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’  “‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",MWS
1703,From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’  “‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’  “I paused.,MWS
1704,"This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever.",MWS
1705,"I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.",MWS
1706,At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.,MWS
1707,"I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the time!",MWS
1708,Save and protect me!,MWS
1709,You and your family are the friends whom I seek.,MWS
1710,Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’  “‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man.,MWS
1711,"‘Who are you?’  “At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered.",MWS
1712,Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?,MWS
1713,"Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage.",MWS
1714,"Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick.",MWS
1715,"I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope.",MWS
1716,"But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained.",MWS
1717,"I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”      Chapter 16  “Cursed, cursed creator!",MWS
1718,Why did I live?,MWS
1719,"Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",MWS
1720,I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.,MWS
1721,I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.,MWS
1722,"“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings.",MWS
1723,"I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.",MWS
1724,What a miserable night I passed!,MWS
1725,"The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness.",MWS
1726,"All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.",MWS
1727,“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair.,MWS
1728,There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies?,MWS
1729,"No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",MWS
1730,“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day.,MWS
1731,"Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.",MWS
1732,"“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions.",MWS
1733,I had certainly acted imprudently.,MWS
1734,"It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.",MWS
1735,"I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been  prepared for my approach.",MWS
1736,"But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.",MWS
1737,"“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.",MWS
1738,The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father’s feet.,MWS
1739,"I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.",MWS
1740,"“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage.",MWS
1741,All there was at peace.,MWS
1742,I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose.,MWS
1743,"That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.",MWS
1744,"I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.",MWS
1745,"The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.",MWS
1746,"“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors.",MWS
1747,"Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.",MWS
1748,"“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him, ‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose the produce of your garden?",MWS
1749,"I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.’  “‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage.",MWS
1750,"The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related.",MWS
1751,My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror.,MWS
1752,I entreat you not to reason with me any more.,MWS
1753,Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.’  “Felix trembled violently as he said this.,MWS
1754,"He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed.",MWS
1755,I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.,MWS
1756,“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair.,MWS
1757,My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world.,MWS
1758,"For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death.",MWS
1759,"When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.",MWS
1760,"But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.",MWS
1761,"As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.",MWS
1762,"“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.",MWS
1763,"I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched.",MWS
1764,"A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected.",MWS
1765,"The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",MWS
1766,"“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.",MWS
1767,"“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",MWS
1768,"I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.",MWS
1769,At length the thought of you crossed my mind.,MWS
1770,"I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?",MWS
1771,"Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.",MWS
1772,"You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.",MWS
1773,“But how was I to direct myself?,MWS
1774,"I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide.",MWS
1775,"I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair.",MWS
1776,"From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.",MWS
1777,You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.,MWS
1778,"But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.",MWS
1779,“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.,MWS
1780,It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.,MWS
1781,"I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being.",MWS
1782,"Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.",MWS
1783,How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!,MWS
1784,"The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness.",MWS
1785,"The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.",MWS
1786,"Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.",MWS
1787,"A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path.",MWS
1788,"The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.",MWS
1789,“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man.,MWS
1790,"One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air.",MWS
1791,"I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me.",MWS
1792,"Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.",MWS
1793,"Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.",MWS
1794,"“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.",MWS
1795,"Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress.",MWS
1796,"I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport.",MWS
1797,"She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream.",MWS
1798,"I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.",MWS
1799,"She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.",MWS
1800,"On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.",MWS
1801,"I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired.",MWS
1802,"I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.",MWS
1803,“This was then the reward of my benevolence!,MWS
1804,"I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.",MWS
1805,The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.,MWS
1806,"Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.",MWS
1807,"But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.",MWS
1808,"“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received.",MWS
1809,"The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it.",MWS
1810,My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.,MWS
1811,"My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.",MWS
1812,"“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.",MWS
1813,The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.,MWS
1814,"“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.",MWS
1815,"“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.",MWS
1816,I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.,MWS
1817,"“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy.",MWS
1818,"Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity.",MWS
1819,"If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.",MWS
1820,"“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me.",MWS
1821,"As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this?",MWS
1822,I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’  “He struggled violently.,MWS
1823,"‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster!",MWS
1824,You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.,MWS
1825,You are an ogre.,MWS
1826,"Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’  “‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’  “‘Hideous monster!",MWS
1827,My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you.,MWS
1828,You dare not keep me.’  “‘Frankenstein!,MWS
1829,"you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’  “The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.",MWS
1830,"“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’  “As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast.",MWS
1831,I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.,MWS
1832,"In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.",MWS
1833,"For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.",MWS
1834,“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?,MWS
1835,"I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them.",MWS
1836,"“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.",MWS
1837,"A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health.",MWS
1838,"Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.",MWS
1839,"And then I bent over her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!’  “The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.",MWS
1840,"Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?",MWS
1841,Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.,MWS
1842,"The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.",MWS
1843,The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!,MWS
1844,"Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief.",MWS
1845,I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.,MWS
1846,"She moved again, and I fled.",MWS
1847,"“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever.",MWS
1848,"At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify.",MWS
1849,We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.,MWS
1850,I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.,MWS
1851,My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects.,MWS
1852,This being you must create.”      Chapter 17  The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply.,MWS
1853,"But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition.",MWS
1854,"He continued,  “You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.",MWS
1855,"This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.”  The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.",MWS
1856,"“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.",MWS
1857,"You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes.",MWS
1858,"Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.",MWS
1859,"I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”  “You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you.",MWS
1860,I am malicious because I am miserable.,MWS
1861,Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?,MWS
1862,"You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me?",MWS
1863,"You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.",MWS
1864,Shall I respect man when he condemns me?,MWS
1865,"Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.",MWS
1866,But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.,MWS
1867,Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.,MWS
1868,"I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.",MWS
1869,"Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.”  A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—  “I intended to reason.",MWS
1870,"This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess.",MWS
1871,"If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the whole kind!",MWS
1872,But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.,MWS
1873,"What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.",MWS
1874,"It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.",MWS
1875,"Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel.",MWS
1876,"My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!",MWS
1877,Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!”  I was moved.,MWS
1878,"I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.",MWS
1879,"His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?",MWS
1880,"He saw my change of feeling and continued,  “If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.",MWS
1881,My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.,MWS
1882,My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.,MWS
1883,We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.,MWS
1884,"The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty.",MWS
1885,"Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”  “You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions.",MWS
1886,"How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?",MWS
1887,"You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.",MWS
1888,"This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”  “How inconstant are your feelings!",MWS
1889,"But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?",MWS
1890,"I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places.",MWS
1891,"My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy!",MWS
1892,"My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”  His words had a strange effect upon me.",MWS
1893,"I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.",MWS
1894,"I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.",MWS
1895,"“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?",MWS
1896,May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?”  “How is this?,MWS
1897,"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.",MWS
1898,"If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.",MWS
1899,"My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.",MWS
1900,I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.”  I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed.,MWS
1901,I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him.,MWS
1902,His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.,MWS
1903,After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.,MWS
1904,"Turning to him, therefore, I said,  “I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”  “I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.",MWS
1905,"Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.”  Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments.",MWS
1906,"I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.",MWS
1907,"His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed.",MWS
1908,"I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow.",MWS
1909,"The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced.",MWS
1910,Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.,MWS
1911,"The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me.",MWS
1912,"I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh!",MWS
1913,"stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”  These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.",MWS
1914,"Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.",MWS
1915,Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.,MWS
1916,"Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family.",MWS
1917,"My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak.",MWS
1918,I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them.,MWS
1919,"Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task.",MWS
1920,"The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.",MWS
1921,"Chapter 18  Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.",MWS
1922,"I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.",MWS
1923,I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition.,MWS
1924,"I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me.",MWS
1925,"A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.",MWS
1926,"My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.",MWS
1927,At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude.,MWS
1928,"I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.",MWS
1929,"But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.",MWS
1930,"It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me,  “I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.",MWS
1931,And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society.,MWS
1932,"For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.",MWS
1933,"Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”  I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—  “I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years.",MWS
1934,"You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another.",MWS
1935,But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it.,MWS
1936,"You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife.",MWS
1937,"Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.”  “My dear father, reassure yourself.",MWS
1938,I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely.,MWS
1939,"I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection.",MWS
1940,"My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”  “The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.",MWS
1941,"If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us.",MWS
1942,But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.,MWS
1943,"Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage.",MWS
1944,"We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.",MWS
1945,"You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.",MWS
1946,"Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.",MWS
1947,"Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.”  I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.",MWS
1948,I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.,MWS
1949,To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay.,MWS
1950,"I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family!",MWS
1951,Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground?,MWS
1952,I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace.,MWS
1953,I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking.,MWS
1954,"The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved.",MWS
1955,"I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror.",MWS
1956,"I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation.",MWS
1957,I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed.,MWS
1958,"Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness.",MWS
1959,"My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever.",MWS
1960,Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever.,MWS
1961,These feelings dictated my answer to my father.,MWS
1962,"I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply.",MWS
1963,"After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.",MWS
1964,"The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated.",MWS
1965,One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.,MWS
1966,"Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh.",MWS
1967,"This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection.",MWS
1968,"Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe.",MWS
1969,"If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?",MWS
1970,"To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.",MWS
1971,My father’s age rendered him extremely averse to delay.,MWS
1972,"For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.",MWS
1973,"I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation.",MWS
1974,"During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure.",MWS
1975,"But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England?",MWS
1976,"This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.",MWS
1977,I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen.,MWS
1978,But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.,MWS
1979,It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.,MWS
1980,"My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.",MWS
1981,It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s sedulous attention.,MWS
1982,"She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.",MWS
1983,"I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.",MWS
1984,"I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me.",MWS
1985,"Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.",MWS
1986,I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.,MWS
1987,"After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval.",MWS
1988,"Alas, how great was the contrast between us!",MWS
1989,"He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day.",MWS
1990,He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky.,MWS
1991,"“This is what it is to live,” he cried; “now I enjoy existence!",MWS
1992,"But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine.",MWS
1993,"And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.",MWS
1994,"I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.",MWS
1995,"We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.",MWS
1996,During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.,MWS
1997,"We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz.",MWS
1998,The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque.,MWS
1999,"The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.",MWS
2000,"We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible.",MWS
2001,"This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape.",MWS
2002,"In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene.",MWS
2003,We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream.,MWS
2004,"Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.",MWS
2005,"I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.",MWS
2006,"And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?",MWS
2007,He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.,MWS
2008,"“I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.",MWS
2009,"The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.",MWS
2010,"Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain.",MWS
2011,"Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.”  Clerval!",MWS
2012,Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.,MWS
2013,He was a being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.,MWS
2014,"His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.",MWS
2015,But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind.,MWS
2016,"The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—       ——The sounding cataract      Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,      The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,      Their colours and their forms, were then to him      An appetite; a feeling, and a love,      That had no need of a remoter charm,      By thought supplied, or any interest      Unborrow’d from the eye.",MWS
2017,And where does he now exist?,MWS
2018,Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever?,MWS
2019,"Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;—has this mind perished?",MWS
2020,Does it now only exist in my memory?,MWS
2021,"No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.",MWS
2022,"Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.",MWS
2023,I will proceed with my tale.,MWS
2024,"Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.",MWS
2025,"Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.",MWS
2026,"It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain.",MWS
2027,"The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story.",MWS
2028,"We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard of even in my country.",MWS
2029,"At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.",MWS
2030,Chapter 19  London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city.,MWS
2031,"Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.",MWS
2032,"If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.",MWS
2033,"But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound.",MWS
2034,"Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.",MWS
2035,"But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart.",MWS
2036,"I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.",MWS
2037,But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction.,MWS
2038,The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.,MWS
2039,He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view.,MWS
2040,"His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade.",MWS
2041,In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.,MWS
2042,"He was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.",MWS
2043,"I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection.",MWS
2044,"I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.",MWS
2045,"I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head.",MWS
2046,"Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",MWS
2047,"After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.",MWS
2048,"He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided.",MWS
2049,"Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.",MWS
2050,"We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February.",MWS
2051,We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month.,MWS
2052,"In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July.",MWS
2053,"I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",MWS
2054,"We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.",MWS
2055,"This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.",MWS
2056,From thence we proceeded to Oxford.,MWS
2057,"As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before.",MWS
2058,It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces.,MWS
2059,"This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty.",MWS
2060,"The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited.",MWS
2061,"The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.",MWS
2062,"If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.",MWS
2063,"The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.",MWS
2064,"I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.",MWS
2065,I was formed for peaceful happiness.,MWS
2066,"During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits.",MWS
2067,"But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",MWS
2068,"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history.",MWS
2069,Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.,MWS
2070,We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.,MWS
2071,For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers.,MWS
2072,"For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.",MWS
2073,"We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest.",MWS
2074,"The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country.",MWS
2075,"We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.",MWS
2076,"The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",MWS
2077,"From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland.",MWS
2078,I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains.,MWS
2079,"The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.",MWS
2080,"Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.",MWS
2081,"The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.",MWS
2082,"“I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”  But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.",MWS
2083,"His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",MWS
2084,"We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.",MWS
2085,For my own part I was not sorry.,MWS
2086,"I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment.",MWS
2087,He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.,MWS
2088,This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.,MWS
2089,"I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.",MWS
2090,Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.,MWS
2091,"When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.",MWS
2092,"I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me.",MWS
2093,"I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",MWS
2094,I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being.,MWS
2095,"Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.",MWS
2096,"But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.",MWS
2097,But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.,MWS
2098,"We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.",MWS
2099,But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone.,MWS
2100,"“Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous.",MWS
2101,"I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.”  Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.",MWS
2102,He entreated me to write often.,MWS
2103,"“I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.”  Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.",MWS
2104,"I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.",MWS
2105,With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.,MWS
2106,"It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.",MWS
2107,"The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.",MWS
2108,"Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.",MWS
2109,"On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived.",MWS
2110,"It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury.",MWS
2111,"The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges.",MWS
2112,"I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty.",MWS
2113,"As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.",MWS
2114,"In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.",MWS
2115,It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene.,MWS
2116,I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.,MWS
2117,"Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains.",MWS
2118,"Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",MWS
2119,"In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.",MWS
2120,"Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.",MWS
2121,"It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged.",MWS
2122,"During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.",MWS
2123,"But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.",MWS
2124,"Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous.",MWS
2125,Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.,MWS
2126,"Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.",MWS
2127,I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.,MWS
2128,"In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.",MWS
2129,"I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.",MWS
2130,"Chapter 20  I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it.",MWS
2131,"As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.",MWS
2132,"Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse.",MWS
2133,"I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.",MWS
2134,"He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.",MWS
2135,"They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?",MWS
2136,"She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.",MWS
2137,"Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror.",MWS
2138,"Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",MWS
2139,"I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.",MWS
2140,"I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement.",MWS
2141,"A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.",MWS
2142,"Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.",MWS
2143,"As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery.",MWS
2144,"I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.",MWS
2145,"The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.",MWS
2146,"I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment.",MWS
2147,I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.,MWS
2148,"Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.",MWS
2149,"A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another.",MWS
2150,"I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.",MWS
2151,"In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly.",MWS
2152,"I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.",MWS
2153,"Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.",MWS
2154,"Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice,  “You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?",MWS
2155,Do you dare to break your promise?,MWS
2156,"I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.",MWS
2157,I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.,MWS
2158,"I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?”  “Begone!",MWS
2159,"I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”  “Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension.",MWS
2160,"Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you.",MWS
2161,"You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!”  “The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived.",MWS
2162,Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice.,MWS
2163,"Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?",MWS
2164,"I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.”  The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger.",MWS
2165,"“Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?",MWS
2166,"I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.",MWS
2167,"You may hate, but beware!",MWS
2168,"Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever.",MWS
2169,Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?,MWS
2170,"You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!",MWS
2171,"I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.",MWS
2172,"Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.",MWS
2173,"I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.",MWS
2174,"Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.”  “Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.",MWS
2175,"I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words.",MWS
2176,Leave me; I am inexorable.”  “It is well.,MWS
2177,"I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.”  I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain!",MWS
2178,"Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”  I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation.",MWS
2179,"In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.",MWS
2180,"All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.",MWS
2181,I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.,MWS
2182,"I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.",MWS
2183,Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?,MWS
2184,"But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.",MWS
2185,I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.,MWS
2186,"And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on your wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.",MWS
2187,In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.,MWS
2188,"The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.",MWS
2189,"The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair.",MWS
2190,"I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.",MWS
2191,"I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.",MWS
2192,"If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I had myself created.",MWS
2193,"I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation.",MWS
2194,"When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep.",MWS
2195,"I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.",MWS
2196,"The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",MWS
2197,"The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him.",MWS
2198,"He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise.",MWS
2199,"He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare.",MWS
2200,"He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together.",MWS
2201,"This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.",MWS
2202,"Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.",MWS
2203,"The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.",MWS
2204,"The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.",MWS
2205,I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber.,MWS
2206,"With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.",MWS
2207,Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon.,MWS
2208,"I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly.",MWS
2209,"The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.",MWS
2210,"I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.",MWS
2211,"Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.",MWS
2212,"The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.",MWS
2213,I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures.,MWS
2214,"At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.",MWS
2215,"The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.",MWS
2216,"But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.",MWS
2217,"Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.",MWS
2218,"I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.",MWS
2219,"The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.",MWS
2220,I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.,MWS
2221,I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.,MWS
2222,"Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.",MWS
2223,I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.,MWS
2224,I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.,MWS
2225,I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.,MWS
2226,"I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.",MWS
2227,"I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.",MWS
2228,"“Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.",MWS
2229,"This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.",MWS
2230,"Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.",MWS
2231,"But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.",MWS
2232,"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.",MWS
2233,"How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!",MWS
2234,I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.,MWS
2235,"It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation.",MWS
2236,I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man.,MWS
2237,I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.,MWS
2238,"As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.",MWS
2239,Fortunately I had money with me.,MWS
2240,"As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.",MWS
2241,"As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot.",MWS
2242,"They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.",MWS
2243,"As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.",MWS
2244,"“My good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?”  “You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.",MWS
2245,"“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”  I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.",MWS
2246,“Why do you answer me so roughly?”  I replied.,MWS
2247,"“Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.”  “I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”  While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.",MWS
2248,"Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.",MWS
2249,"I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.",MWS
2250,"I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”  “Who is Mr. Kirwin?",MWS
2251,Why am I to give an account of myself?,MWS
2252,"Is not this a free country?”  “Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.",MWS
2253,"Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”  This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.",MWS
2254,I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.,MWS
2255,"I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.",MWS
2256,Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.,MWS
2257,"I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.",MWS
2258,"Chapter 21  I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners.",MWS
2259,"He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.",MWS
2260,"About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port.",MWS
2261,"It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.",MWS
2262,"He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.",MWS
2263,"As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground.",MWS
2264,"His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.",MWS
2265,"Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold.",MWS
2266,"They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life.",MWS
2267,"It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age.",MWS
2268,"He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",MWS
2269,"The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.",MWS
2270,The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.,MWS
2271,"The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.",MWS
2272,"A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.",MWS
2273,Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.,MWS
2274,"They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.",MWS
2275,"Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.",MWS
2276,"Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",MWS
2277,"Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.",MWS
2278,This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.,MWS
2279,"I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.",MWS
2280,"I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.",MWS
2281,I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.,MWS
2282,How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?,MWS
2283,"I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.",MWS
2284,"The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.",MWS
2285,"I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life?",MWS
2286,"Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor—”  The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.",MWS
2287,A fever succeeded to this.,MWS
2288,"I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.",MWS
2289,"Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.",MWS
2290,"Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.",MWS
2291,Why did I not die?,MWS
2292,"More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?",MWS
2293,"Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!",MWS
2294,"Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?",MWS
2295,"But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.",MWS
2296,"It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.",MWS
2297,This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.,MWS
2298,"She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class.",MWS
2299,"The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery.",MWS
2300,"Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.",MWS
2301,"“Are you better now, sir?” said she.",MWS
2302,"I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.”  “For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!",MWS
2303,"However, that’s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”  I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.",MWS
2304,"The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.",MWS
2305,"As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.",MWS
2306,"The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.",MWS
2307,Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?,MWS
2308,"These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness.",MWS
2309,He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.,MWS
2310,"It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer.",MWS
2311,"He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals.",MWS
2312,"One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.",MWS
2313,I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.,MWS
2314,"At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.",MWS
2315,Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.,MWS
2316,"His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French,  “I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?”  “I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”  “I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.",MWS
2317,"But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”  “That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals.",MWS
2318,"Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?”  “Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred.",MWS
2319,"You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder.",MWS
2320,"The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.”  As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.",MWS
2321,"I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say,  “Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.",MWS
2322,"I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.",MWS
2323,I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.,MWS
2324,"But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.”  “This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?”  “Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”  I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.",MWS
2325,"I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony,  “Oh!",MWS
2326,"I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter!”  Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.",MWS
2327,"He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone,  “I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”  “My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure.",MWS
2328,“Is my father indeed come?,MWS
2329,"How kind, how very kind!",MWS
2330,"But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”  My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.",MWS
2331,"He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.",MWS
2332,"Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father.",MWS
2333,"I stretched out my hand to him and cried,  “Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”  My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.",MWS
2334,"“What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!” said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room.",MWS
2335,"“You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you.",MWS
2336,And poor Clerval—”  The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.,MWS
2337,"Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.”  We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity.",MWS
2338,Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.,MWS
2339,"But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.",MWS
2340,"As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate.",MWS
2341,"The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly and murdered.",MWS
2342,More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.,MWS
2343,Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?,MWS
2344,"It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close.",MWS
2345,"Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.",MWS
2346,"Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.",MWS
2347,The season of the assizes approached.,MWS
2348,"I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held.",MWS
2349,Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.,MWS
2350,"I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death.",MWS
2351,"The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.",MWS
2352,"My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.",MWS
2353,"I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful.",MWS
2354,"The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.",MWS
2355,"Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",MWS
2356,My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.,MWS
2357,"He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me.",MWS
2358,"Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair.",MWS
2359,"At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",MWS
2360,"Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair.",MWS
2361,"It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous.",MWS
2362,"My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being.",MWS
2363,My strength was gone.,MWS
2364,"I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.",MWS
2365,"Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield.",MWS
2366,We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.,MWS
2367,I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves.,MWS
2368,"I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.",MWS
2369,"The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.",MWS
2370,"I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt.",MWS
2371,"I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived.",MWS
2372,"I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",MWS
2373,"Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.",MWS
2374,"Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.",MWS
2375,But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.,MWS
2376,Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.,MWS
2377,"My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.",MWS
2378,Chapter 22  The voyage came to an end.,MWS
2379,"We landed, and proceeded to Paris.",MWS
2380,I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey.,MWS
2381,"My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.",MWS
2382,He wished me to seek amusement in society.,MWS
2383,I abhorred the face of man.,MWS
2384,"They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism.",MWS
2385,But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse.,MWS
2386,I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.,MWS
2387,"How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",MWS
2388,My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.,MWS
2389,"Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",MWS
2390,"My father,” said I, “how little do you know me.",MWS
2391,"Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride.",MWS
2392,"Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her.",MWS
2393,"William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.”  My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence.",MWS
2394,I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created.,MWS
2395,"I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue.",MWS
2396,"But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast.",MWS
2397,"I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.",MWS
2398,"Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me.",MWS
2399,"I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.",MWS
2400,"Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?",MWS
2401,"My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.”  “I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.",MWS
2402,I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.,MWS
2403,"A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.”  The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.",MWS
2404,He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.,MWS
2405,"As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.",MWS
2406,"By the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.",MWS
2407,"A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:  “My dear Friend,  “It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight.",MWS
2408,"My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered!",MWS
2409,I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva.,MWS
2410,"This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.",MWS
2411,"“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.",MWS
2412,"I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.",MWS
2413,"You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?",MWS
2414,"If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.",MWS
2415,"But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.",MWS
2416,"“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy.",MWS
2417,"We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.",MWS
2418,"We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.",MWS
2419,"But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case?",MWS
2420,"Tell me, dearest Victor.",MWS
2421,"Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?",MWS
2422,"“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.",MWS
2423,But this is false reasoning.,MWS
2424,"I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion.",MWS
2425,But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.,MWS
2426,"Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.",MWS
2427,"I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.",MWS
2428,"Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition.",MWS
2429,"Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.",MWS
2430,"“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.",MWS
2431,"My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.",MWS
2432,"“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”    This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend—“_I will be with you on your wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.",MWS
2433,On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death.,MWS
2434,"Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.",MWS
2435,"If he were vanquished, I should be a free man.",MWS
2436,"Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free.",MWS
2437,"Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",MWS
2438,Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!,MWS
2439,"I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope.",MWS
2440,Yet I would die to make her happy.,MWS
2441,"If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.",MWS
2442,"My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.",MWS
2443,"He had vowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats.",MWS
2444,"I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.",MWS
2445,In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.,MWS
2446,My letter was calm and affectionate.,MWS
2447,"“I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you.",MWS
2448,Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment.,MWS
2449,"I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.",MWS
2450,"I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.",MWS
2451,"But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.",MWS
2452,"This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”  In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned to Geneva.",MWS
2453,"The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks.",MWS
2454,I saw a change in her also.,MWS
2455,She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.,MWS
2456,The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.,MWS
2457,"Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent.",MWS
2458,"I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",MWS
2459,Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.,MWS
2460,She wept with me and for me.,MWS
2461,"When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation.",MWS
2462,"It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace.",MWS
2463,The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.,MWS
2464,Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth.,MWS
2465,"“Have you, then, some other attachment?”  “None on earth.",MWS
2466,I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight.,MWS
2467,"Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”  “My dear Victor, do not speak thus.",MWS
2468,"Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.",MWS
2469,Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.,MWS
2470,"And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.”  Such were the lessons of my father.",MWS
2471,"But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable.",MWS
2472,"But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.",MWS
2473,"If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.",MWS
2474,"But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.",MWS
2475,"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.",MWS
2476,"But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.",MWS
2477,"She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.",MWS
2478,"Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance.",MWS
2479,"I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.",MWS
2480,Through my father’s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.,MWS
2481,A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.,MWS
2482,"It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.",MWS
2483,In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.,MWS
2484,"I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.",MWS
2485,"Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",MWS
2486,Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind.,MWS
2487,"But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day.",MWS
2488,"My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",MWS
2489,"After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day.",MWS
2490,"The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",MWS
2491,Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.,MWS
2492,"We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",MWS
2493,I took the hand of Elizabeth.,MWS
2494,"“You are sorrowful, my love.",MWS
2495,"If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.”  “Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented.",MWS
2496,"Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.",MWS
2497,"Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting.",MWS
2498,"Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.",MWS
2499,What a divine day!,MWS
2500,How happy and serene all nature appears!”  Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.,MWS
2501,"But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.",MWS
2502,The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.,MWS
2503,"The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.",MWS
2504,The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.,MWS
2505,"The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay.",MWS
2506,"The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.",MWS
2507,"Chapter 23  It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.",MWS
2508,"The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west.",MWS
2509,"The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise.",MWS
2510,Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.,MWS
2511,"I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.",MWS
2512,"I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished.",MWS
2513,"Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?",MWS
2514,What is it you fear?”  “Oh!,MWS
2515,"Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”  I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",MWS
2516,"She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary.",MWS
2517,But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream.,MWS
2518,It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.,MWS
2519,"As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.",MWS
2520,"This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.",MWS
2521,Why did I not then expire!,MWS
2522,Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?,MWS
2523,"She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.",MWS
2524,Everywhere I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.,MWS
2525,Could I behold this and live?,MWS
2526,Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.,MWS
2527,For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.,MWS
2528,"When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me.",MWS
2529,"I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.",MWS
2530,"She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep.",MWS
2531,"I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.",MWS
2532,"The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.",MWS
2533,"While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.",MWS
2534,"The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.",MWS
2535,"The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.",MWS
2536,"A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.",MWS
2537,"I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.",MWS
2538,The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.,MWS
2539,"I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.",MWS
2540,"After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy.",MWS
2541,"After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.",MWS
2542,"I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.",MWS
2543,"In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.",MWS
2544,"After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay.",MWS
2545,"There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause.",MWS
2546,"I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.",MWS
2547,"The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet.",MWS
2548,This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.,MWS
2549,I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.,MWS
2550,"There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.",MWS
2551,"However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.",MWS
2552,"I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.",MWS
2553,"But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion.",MWS
2554,"I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.",MWS
2555,"If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.",MWS
2556,Tears streamed from my eyes.,MWS
2557,"The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.",MWS
2558,Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.,MWS
2559,"The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.",MWS
2560,A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.,MWS
2561,But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event?,MWS
2562,"Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.",MWS
2563,"Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.",MWS
2564,"My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.",MWS
2565,I arrived at Geneva.,MWS
2566,"My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore.",MWS
2567,"I see him now, excellent and venerable old man!",MWS
2568,"His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.",MWS
2569,"Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness!",MWS
2570,"He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",MWS
2571,What then became of me?,MWS
2572,"I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.",MWS
2573,"Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon.",MWS
2574,"Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison.",MWS
2575,"For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.",MWS
2576,"Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.",MWS
2577,"As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction.",MWS
2578,"I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.",MWS
2579,"Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.",MWS
2580,The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.,MWS
2581,"“Be assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.”  “I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make.",MWS
2582,"It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.",MWS
2583,"The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.",MWS
2584,"I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",MWS
2585,"The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.",MWS
2586,"When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.",MWS
2587,"It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.”  This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor.",MWS
2588,"He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned.",MWS
2589,"He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance.",MWS
2590,Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?,MWS
2591,"Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”  “I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey.",MWS
2592,"But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”  As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.",MWS
2593,"“You are mistaken,” said he.",MWS
2594,"“I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.",MWS
2595,"But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.”  “That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.",MWS
2596,"My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.",MWS
2597,"My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists.",MWS
2598,"You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.”  I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.",MWS
2599,"But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness.",MWS
2600,He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.,MWS
2601,"“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!",MWS
2602,Cease; you know not what it is you say.”  I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.,MWS
2603,Chapter 24  My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.,MWS
2604,I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.,MWS
2605,"My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful.",MWS
2606,"I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.",MWS
2607,And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.,MWS
2608,I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.,MWS
2609,How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.,MWS
2610,But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.,MWS
2611,When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.,MWS
2612,"But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue.",MWS
2613,"As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed.",MWS
2614,I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves.,MWS
2615,"Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer.",MWS
2616,"The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.",MWS
2617,The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair.,MWS
2618,"They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.",MWS
2619,"I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.",MWS
2620,"For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever.",MWS
2621,"And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.",MWS
2622,"Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.”  I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.",MWS
2623,I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh.,MWS
2624,"It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.",MWS
2625,Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance.,MWS
2626,"The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch!",MWS
2627,"You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”  I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp.",MWS
2628,Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.,MWS
2629,"I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.",MWS
2630,"Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.",MWS
2631,"The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.",MWS
2632,"I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.",MWS
2633,"Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.",MWS
2634,"Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.",MWS
2635,"The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain.",MWS
2636,"To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?",MWS
2637,"Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.",MWS
2638,"Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.",MWS
2639,"The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.",MWS
2640,"Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.",MWS
2641,"I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected.",MWS
2642,"In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path.",MWS
2643,"I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.",MWS
2644,"My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy.",MWS
2645,"Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.",MWS
2646,"The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.",MWS
2647,"Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.",MWS
2648,"During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth.",MWS
2649,"Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.",MWS
2650,What agonising fondness did I feel for them!,MWS
2651,"How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!",MWS
2652,"At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.",MWS
2653,What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.,MWS
2654,"Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury.",MWS
2655,"“My reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete.",MWS
2656,"Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive.",MWS
2657,"You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.",MWS
2658,"Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”  Scoffing devil!",MWS
2659,"Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death.",MWS
2660,"Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",MWS
2661,"As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.",MWS
2662,"The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey.",MWS
2663,"The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.",MWS
2664,The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.,MWS
2665,One inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare!,MWS
2666,"Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.”  My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon.",MWS
2667,How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south!,MWS
2668,"Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness.",MWS
2669,"The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils.",MWS
2670,"I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.",MWS
2671,Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.,MWS
2672,"I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.",MWS
2673,"With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore.",MWS
2674,I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information.,MWS
2675,"A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance.",MWS
2676,"He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts.",MWS
2677,On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.,MWS
2678,"He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.",MWS
2679,"Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.",MWS
2680,"After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.",MWS
2681,"I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.",MWS
2682,"I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.",MWS
2683,"Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.",MWS
2684,But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.,MWS
2685,"By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes.",MWS
2686,"Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.",MWS
2687,"Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.",MWS
2688,I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within.,MWS
2689,With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!,MWS
2690,"Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.",MWS
2691,"But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route.",MWS
2692,"The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.",MWS
2693,"I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.",MWS
2694,"But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before.",MWS
2695,"A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific.",MWS
2696,"I pressed on, but in vain.",MWS
2697,"The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.",MWS
2698,"The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.",MWS
2699,"In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.",MWS
2700,I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight.,MWS
2701,"I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship.",MWS
2702,"I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.",MWS
2703,I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy.,MWS
2704,But your direction was northwards.,MWS
2705,"You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.",MWS
2706,"When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?",MWS
2707,"If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death.",MWS
2708,"And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?",MWS
2709,No; I am not so selfish.,MWS
2710,"Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.",MWS
2711,"He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not.",MWS
2712,"His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice.",MWS
2713,"Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart.",MWS
2714,I will hover near and direct the steel aright.,MWS
2715,"Walton, _in continuation._   August 26th, 17—.",MWS
2716,"You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?",MWS
2717,"Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish.",MWS
2718,"His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness.",MWS
2719,"Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.",MWS
2720,"His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected.",MWS
2721,"Such a monster has, then, really existence!",MWS
2722,"I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration.",MWS
2723,"Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.",MWS
2724,"“Are you mad, my friend?” said he.",MWS
2725,“Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?,MWS
2726,Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?,MWS
2727,"Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.”  Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy.",MWS
2728,"“Since you have preserved my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.”  Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed.",MWS
2729,My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.,MWS
2730,"I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?",MWS
2731,The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death.,MWS
2732,"Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world.",MWS
2733,This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.,MWS
2734,Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes.,MWS
2735,On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.,MWS
2736,"His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears.",MWS
2737,"What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!",MWS
2738,He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.,MWS
2739,"“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for some great enterprise.",MWS
2740,"My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.",MWS
2741,"This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.",MWS
2742,"When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors.",MWS
2743,"But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust.",MWS
2744,"All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.",MWS
2745,"My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man.",MWS
2746,Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.,MWS
2747,"I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects.",MWS
2748,From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk!,MWS
2749,"My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation.",MWS
2750,"Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.”  Must I then lose this admirable being?",MWS
2751,I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me.,MWS
2752,"Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him.",MWS
2753,"I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.",MWS
2754,"“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?",MWS
2755,"Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?",MWS
2756,"Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.",MWS
2757,"They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.",MWS
2758,"A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion.",MWS
2759,"But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear.",MWS
2760,"They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.",MWS
2761,"If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.",MWS
2762,"But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”  My beloved Sister,  September 2d.",MWS
2763,"I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it.",MWS
2764,I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel.,MWS
2765,"The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow.",MWS
2766,"There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.",MWS
2767,Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me.,MWS
2768,"If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.",MWS
2769,"And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?",MWS
2770,"You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.",MWS
2771,"Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope.",MWS
2772,"My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.",MWS
2773,But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.,MWS
2774,Heaven bless you and make you so!,MWS
2775,My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.,MWS
2776,He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued.,MWS
2777,"He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.",MWS
2778,"Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man.",MWS
2779,"These feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.",MWS
2780,"A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.",MWS
2781,"We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict.",MWS
2782,"The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.",MWS
2783,"Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.",MWS
2784,I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.,MWS
2785,"This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.",MWS
2786,"They entered, and their leader addressed me.",MWS
2787,"He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.",MWS
2788,"We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.",MWS
2789,"They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.",MWS
2790,This speech troubled me.,MWS
2791,"I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free.",MWS
2792,"Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",MWS
2793,"I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.",MWS
2794,"Turning towards the men, he said,  “What do you mean?",MWS
2795,What do you demand of your captain?,MWS
2796,"Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?",MWS
2797,Did you not call this a glorious expedition?,MWS
2798,“And wherefore was it glorious?,MWS
2799,"Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome.",MWS
2800,"For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking.",MWS
2801,"You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind.",MWS
2802,"And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides.",MWS
2803,"Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards.",MWS
2804,"Be men, or be more than men.",MWS
2805,Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock.,MWS
2806,This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not.,MWS
2807,Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows.,MWS
2808,"Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”  He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?",MWS
2809,They looked at one another and were unable to reply.,MWS
2810,"I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.",MWS
2811,"They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life.",MWS
2812,"How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.",MWS
2813,"Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.",MWS
2814,The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.,MWS
2815,Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed.,MWS
2816,It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.,MWS
2817,It is past; I am returning to England.,MWS
2818,I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend.,MWS
2819,"But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond.",MWS
2820,"September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction.",MWS
2821,"We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed.",MWS
2822,"The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free.",MWS
2823,"When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued.",MWS
2824,"Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult.",MWS
2825,"“They shout,” I said, “because they will soon return to England.”  “Do you, then, really return?”  “Alas!",MWS
2826,Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.,MWS
2827,"I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”  “Do so, if you will; but I will not.",MWS
2828,"You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not.",MWS
2829,"I am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.”  Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.",MWS
2830,"It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct.",MWS
2831,At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak.,MWS
2832,The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed.,MWS
2833,In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.,MWS
2834,"His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.",MWS
2835,"I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, “Alas!",MWS
2836,"The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being.",MWS
2837,"Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.",MWS
2838,During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.,MWS
2839,"In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being.",MWS
2840,"This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that.",MWS
2841,My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery.,MWS
2842,"Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature.",MWS
2843,"He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end.",MWS
2844,"Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die.",MWS
2845,"The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.",MWS
2846,"When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.",MWS
2847,"“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him.",MWS
2848,"But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death.",MWS
2849,"I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion.",MWS
2850,"“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.",MWS
2851,"The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.",MWS
2852,"Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries.",MWS
2853,Yet why do I say this?,MWS
2854,"I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”  His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence.",MWS
2855,"About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.",MWS
2856,"Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?",MWS
2857,What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?,MWS
2858,All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble.,MWS
2859,My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.,MWS
2860,"But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.",MWS
2861,What do these sounds portend?,MWS
2862,"It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.",MWS
2863,"Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.",MWS
2864,I must arise and examine.,MWS
2865,"Good night, my sister.",MWS
2866,what a scene has just taken place!,MWS
2867,I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it.,MWS
2868,I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.,MWS
2869,I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.,MWS
2870,"Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions.",MWS
2871,"As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.",MWS
2872,"When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window.",MWS
2873,"Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness.",MWS
2874,I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.,MWS
2875,I called on him to stay.,MWS
2876,"He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.",MWS
2877,“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed.,MWS
2878,“In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!,MWS
2879,Generous and self-devoted being!,MWS
2880,What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?,MWS
2881,"I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst.",MWS
2882,"He is cold, he cannot answer me.”  His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.",MWS
2883,"I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.",MWS
2884,"I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.",MWS
2885,The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.,MWS
2886,At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.,MWS
2887,"“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous.",MWS
2888,"If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.”  “And do you dream?” said the dæmon.",MWS
2889,“Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?,MWS
2890,"He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse, “he suffered not in the consummation of the deed.",MWS
2891,Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution.,MWS
2892,"A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.",MWS
2893,Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears?,MWS
2894,"My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.",MWS
2895,"“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome.",MWS
2896,I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself.,MWS
2897,"But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.",MWS
2898,I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.,MWS
2899,"I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey.",MWS
2900,Yet when she died!,MWS
2901,"Nay, then I was not miserable.",MWS
2902,"I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair.",MWS
2903,Evil thenceforth became my good.,MWS
2904,"Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen.",MWS
2905,The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.,MWS
2906,"And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”  I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.",MWS
2907,“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made.,MWS
2908,"You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.",MWS
2909,"If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.",MWS
2910,"It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.”  “Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.",MWS
2911,“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions.,MWS
2912,Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.,MWS
2913,No sympathy may I ever find.,MWS
2914,"When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.",MWS
2915,"But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",MWS
2916,"I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.",MWS
2917,"Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.",MWS
2918,"Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.",MWS
2919,I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion.,MWS
2920,But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.,MWS
2921,"No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.",MWS
2922,"When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.",MWS
2923,But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.,MWS
2924,Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.,MWS
2925,"“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes.",MWS
2926,But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.,MWS
2927,"For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires.",MWS
2928,"They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.",MWS
2929,Was there no injustice in this?,MWS
2930,"Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me?",MWS
2931,"Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely?",MWS
2932,Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child?,MWS
2933,"Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings!",MWS
2934,"I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.",MWS
2935,Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.,MWS
2936,“But it is true that I am a wretch.,MWS
2937,I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.,MWS
2938,"I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin.",MWS
2939,"There he lies, white and cold in death.",MWS
2940,"You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.",MWS
2941,"I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.",MWS
2942,“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.,MWS
2943,My work is nearly complete.,MWS
2944,"Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own.",MWS
2945,Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.,MWS
2946,"I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been.",MWS
2947,"I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.",MWS
2948,"He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.",MWS
2949,I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.,MWS
2950,"Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness.",MWS
2951,"Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation.",MWS
2952,"Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?",MWS
2953,"I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold.",MWS
2954,"If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction.",MWS
2955,"But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel.",MWS
2956,"Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.",MWS
2957,"“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.",MWS
2958,Soon these burning miseries will be extinct.,MWS
2959,I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames.,MWS
2960,The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.,MWS
2961,"My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.",MWS
2962,"Farewell.”  He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel.",MWS
2963,He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.,MWS
